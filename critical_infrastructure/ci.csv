Current trends and initiatives, such as 'Industrie 4.0' and Internet of Things (IoT), promise innovative business models and novel user experiences through strong connectivity and effective use of next generation of embedded devices. These systems generate, process, and exchange vast amounts of security-critical and privacy-sensitive data, which makes them attractive targets of attacks. Cyberattacks on IoT systems are very critical since they may cause physical damage and even threaten human lives. The complexity of these systems and the potential impact of cyberattacks bring upon new threats. This paper gives an introduction to Industrial IoT systems, the related security and privacy challenges, and an outlook on possible solutions towards a holistic security framework for Industrial IoT systems. © 2015 ACM.",,"Computer aided design; Computer privacy; Crashworthiness; Embedded systems; Internet; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Industrial control systems; Internet of Things (IOT); Potential impacts; Security and privacy; Security frameworks; Security-critical; Strong connectivity; Internet of things","(2008) International Federation of Automatic Control, , SmartFactory | From Vision to Reality in Factory Technologies; Alcaraz, C., Roman, R., Najera, P., Lopez, J., Security of industrial sensor network-based remote substations in the context of the internet of things (2013) Ad Hoc Netw, 11 (3); Arbaugh, W., Farber, D., Smith, J., A secure and reliable bootstrap architecture (1997) IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (S&P); Armknecht, F., Sadeghi, A.-R., Schulz, S., Wachsmann, C., A security framework for the analysis and design of software attestation (2013) ACM Conference on Computer &Communications Security (CCS).

However, research on business models affected through Industry 4.0, and on small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), remains scarce. In response, the purpose of this paper is to address both aspects, further elaborating on the role that SMEs can take toward Industry 4.0 as provider or user. Design/methodology/approach: The paper used an exploratory research design based on 43 in-depth expert interviews within the three most important German industry sectors, mechanical and plant engineering, electrical engineering and automotive suppliers. Interviews were conducted with leading personnel of the respective enterprises, including 22 CEOs. They assign business model implications through Industry 4.0, referring to the Business Model Canvas, while the paper delineates between Industry 4.0 providers and users. Findings: The paper finds that key resources and value proposition are among the most affected elements of the business model, whereas channels are the least affected. Furthermore, distinct characteristics between Industry 4.0 providers and users can be delineated. In general, Industry 4.0 providers’ business models are significantly more affected than users, except for key partners and customer relationships. Research limitations/implications: Industry 4.0 remains at its early stages of implementation. As a result, many interviewees’ answers remain at a rather general level. Practical implications: Strategies for the further alignment of the business models are provided for Industry 4.0 providers and users. Originality/value: The paper is among the few that investigate Industry 4.0 in the context of SMEs and business models. © 2019, Julian Marius Müller.","Case studies; Industry 4.0; Manufacturing industry; Small- and medium-sized enterprises","Industry 4.0; Public relations; Automotive suppliers; Business model innovation; Case-studies; Customer relationships; Design/methodology/approach; Exploratory research; Manufacturing industries; Small and medium sized enterprise; Automotive industry","Arnold, C., Kiel, D., Voigt, K.I., How the industrial internet of things changes business models in different manufacturing industries (2016) International Journal of Innovation Management, 20 (8), pp. 1-25; Baden-Fuller, C., Haefliger, S., Business models and technological innovation (2013) Long Range Planning, 46 (6), pp. 419-426; Bresnahan, T.F., Trajtenberg, M., General purpose technologies: engines of growth?

It serves as a novel manufacturing paradigm ensuring flexibility and adaptability of production systems and value chains in order to maintain the future global competitiveness of manufacturing enterprises. Its implicated technological change will additionally result in extensive organizational consequences; existing value chains will change resulting in opportunities for new business models (BM). Consequently, established BMs have to be reflected critically. In general, the IIoT constitutes a relatively young research field. While prior literature concentrated on technological aspects, economic has a backlog compared to technical research. Nevertheless, some authors are already dealing with potential influences of the IIoT on BMs in general, but merely focus on specific aspects and have to be regarded in the respective light of their field of research. Thus, there is no comprehensive picture about the impact of the IIoT on established BMs. Hence, this paper addresses this research gap by answering the research question: In what way does academic literature address the impact of the IIoT on BMs of established manufacturers? For this purpose, a systematic literature review is chosen as research method. After a structured selection process with regard to high quality and subject relevance, we eventually identified 87 articles of journals, collected editions, as well as studies of research institutions published between 2011 and 2015, which are analyzed in detail. Subsequently, these were synthesized according to the nine components of the BM Canvas by Osterwalder and Pigneur serving as the analytical framework of this review. Our results show that existing academic literature mainly focuses on IIoT-triggered changes of companieś key resources and activities, whereas particularly the entire customer perspective is mostly disregarded. Furthermore, none of the reviewed scientific works comprehensively deal with the influences of the IIoT on the entire set of BM components at all. Regarding the most prominent qualitative BM changes, we disclose that the IIoT enables an increasing offering of customized, individualized, and smart products and services associated by a consequent service-orientation. For the purpose of the latter, customers are increasingly integrated in development and manufacturing processes on a collaborative basis. In addition, the IIoT-inherent generation of enormous amounts of undirected data, i.e. big data, requires target-oriented data analysis, which then again necessitates specific experts capable of data mining and processing activities. For all the IIoT's intelligent production systems, human beings associated with their keen senses still represent resources of particular importance. Since one of our research goals is to derive need for further research, the review enables us to identify areas to be examined more extensively in future. For instance and among others, we suggest to investigate the customer perspective in more detail as well as to examine the BM as an entire system contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of changes in the context of the IIoT. In conclusion, our paper contributes to a better understanding of IIoT-triggered BM changes, which is not only valuable for academia, but also for enterprises facing the integration of the internet into their value creation processes.","Business Model Innovation; Business Models; Industrial Internet of Things; Industrial Manufacturing; Industrie 4.0; Systematic Literature Review","Big data; Chains; Competition; Data handling; Data mining; Industrial economics; Industrial management; Internet; Internet of things; Manufacture; Sales; Societies and institutions; Business model innovation; Business models; Industrial manufacturing; Industrie 4.0; Systematic literature review; Industrial research","Adolph, M., Big data, its enablers and standards (2014) PIK-Praxis der Informationsverarbeitung und Kommunikation, 37 (3), pp. 197-204; Amit, R., Zott, C., Value creation in e-business (2001) Strategic Management Journal, 22 (6-7), pp. 493-520; Amit, R., Zott, C., Creating value through business model innovation (2012) MIT Sloan Management Review, 53 (3), pp. 41-49; Bauer, W., Schlund, S., Marrenbach, D., Ganschar, O., (2014) Industrie 4.0-Volkswirtschaftliches Potenzial für Deutschland, , Berlin, Stuttgart: BITKOM, Fraunhofer IAO; Bauernhansl, T., Die Vierte Industrielle Revolution-Der Weg in ein wertsch affendes Produktionsparadigma (2014) Industrie 4.0 in Produktion, Automatisierung und Logistik-Anwendung, Technologien, Migration, pp. 5-35. , T Bauernhansl, M ten Hompel and B Vogel-Heuser (eds..

The Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is also part of IoT-oriented infrastructure. CPS has gained considerable success in industrial applications and critical infrastructure with a distributed environment. This system aims to integrate the physical world to computational facilities as cyberspace. However, there are many challenges, such as security and privacy, centralization, communication latency, scalability in such an environment. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a Deep Learning-based IoT-oriented infrastructure for a secure smart city where Blockchain provides a distributed environment at the communication phase of CPS, and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) establishes the protocols for data forwarding in the network. A deep learning-based cloud is utilized at the application layer of the proposed infrastructure to resolve communication latency and centralization, scalability. It enables cost-effective, high-performance computing resources for smart city applications such as the smart industry, smart transportation. Finally, we evaluated the performance of our proposed infrastructure. We compared it with existing methods using quantitative analysis and security and privacy analysis with different measures such as scalability and latency. The evaluation of our implementation results shows that performance is improved. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Blockchain; CPS; Deep learning; IoT-oriented infrastructure; SDN; Security and privacy; Smart City","Cost effectiveness; Embedded systems; Internet of things; Network security; Scalability; Smart city; Communication latency; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Distributed environments; High-performance computing resources; Internet of thing (IOT); Security and privacy; Security and privacy analysis; Software defined networking (SDN); Deep learning","Al-Turjman, F., Intelligence and security in big 5G-oriented IoNT: An overview (2020) Future Generation Computer Systems, 102, pp. 357-368; Al-Turjman, F., Zahmatkesh, H., Mostarda, L., Quantifying uncertainty in the internet of medical things and big-data services using intelligence and deep learning (2019) IEEE Access : Practical Innovations, Open Solutions, 7, pp. 115749-115759; Bhattacharya, P., Tanwar, S., Bodkhe, U., Tyagi, S., BinDaas: Blockchain-based deep learning as-a-service in healthcare 4.0 applications (2019) Transactions of Network Science and Engineering; Chollet, F., Keras: The python deep learning library.

In the context of smart-world critical infrastructures and cyber-physical systems, the rapid adoption of the IoT systems and infrastructures without thorough consideration for the risks and vulnerabilities has the potential for catastrophic damage to the privacy, safety, and security of individuals and corporations. While the IoT systems have the potential to increase productivity, accountability, traceability, and efficiency, their potential weaknesses are also more abundant. In this paper, we provide critical consideration of the security of the IoT systems as applied to smart-world critical infrastructures. Particularly, we carry out a detailed assessment of vulnerabilities in IoT-based critical infrastructures from the perspectives of applications, networking, operating systems, software, firmware, and hardware. In addition, we highlight the three key critical infrastructure IoT-based cyber-physical systems, namely the smart transportation, smart manufacturing, and smart grid. Moreover, we provide a broad collection of attack examples upon each of the key applications. Furthermore, we introduce a case study, in which we assess the impacts of potential attacks on critical IoT-based systems, using the smart transportation system as an example. Finally, we provide a set of best practices and address the necessary steps to enact countermeasures for any generic IoT-based critical infrastructure system. © 2013 IEEE.","case study; computing infrastructure; critical infrastructure; Cyber-physical systems; Internet of Things; security","Application programs; Critical infrastructures; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Firmware; Public works; Catastrophic damage; Computing infrastructures; Critical infrastructure systems; Internet of thing (IOT); Internet of Things (IOT); Research opportunities; security; Transportation system; Internet of things","Stankovic, J.A., Research directions for the Internet of Things (2014) IEEE Internet Things J., 1 (1), pp. 3-9. , Feb; Lin, J., Yu, W., Zhang, N., Yang, X., Zhang, H., Zhao, W., A survey on Internet of things: Architecture, enabling technologies, security and privacy, and applications (2017) IEEE Internet Things J., 4 (5), pp. 1125-1142. , Oct; Yu, W., Liang, F., He, X., Hatcher, W.G., Lu, C., Lin, J., Yang, X., A survey on the edge computing for the Internet of Things (2018) IEEE Access, 6, pp. 6900-6919; Lin, J., Yu, W., Yang, X., Yang, Q., Fu, X., Zhao, W., A novel dynamic en-route decision real-time route guidance scheme in intelligent transportation systems (2015) Proc.

Traditionally, to meet diverging use case requirements regarding network data rate, delay, security, reliability and flexibility, dedicated communication infrastructures are employed. Yet, this is associated with high costs and lengthy roll-out times. Therefore it is desirable for multiple tenants to share one Physical Network (PN). However, this may compromise service guarantees, potentially violating Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Network slicing aims to address this challenge by transparently dividing one common infrastructure into multiple, logically independent networks. Thereby tenants are isolated from one another, ensuring the fulfillment of hard performance guarantees. As slicing is central to realizing the potential of 5G networks, this work presents a novel approach based on Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) driven queueing strategies. The developed solution is comprehensively evaluated with realistic traffic in a physical testing environment. Highly demanding critical infrastructure use cases, with multiple service levels per slice, are used to validate performance and demonstrate functionalities such as dynamic data rate allocation. © 2018 IEEE.",,,"Yan, Y., Qian, Y., Sharif, H., Tipper, D., A survey on smart grid communication infrastructures: Motivations, requirements and challenges (2013) IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 15 (1), pp. 5-20; Ordonez-Lucena, J., Network Slicing for 5G with SDN/NFV: Concepts, architectures, and challenges (2017) IEEE Communications Magazine, 55 (5), pp. 80-87. , May; El Hattachi, R., Erfanian, J., NGMN 5G initiative white paper (2015) NGMN (Next Generation Mobile Network) Alliance, , https://www.ngmn.org/uploads/media/NGMN5GWhitePaperV10.pdf, White Paper; Mallinson, K., The path to 5G: As much evolution as revolution (2016) 3GPP-The Mobile Broadband Standard, , http://www.3gpp.org/news-events/3gpp-news/1774-5gwiseharbour, May; Karagiannis, G., Vehicular networking: A survey and tutorial on requirements, architectures, challenges, standards and solutions (2011) IEEE Comm.

They are not closed within a cyberspace anymore and having interaction with our real world with sensors and actuators. Such systems are known as CPS (Cyber Physical Systems), IoT/E (Internet of Things/Everything), Industry 4.0, Industrial Internet, M2M, etc. No matter what they are called, exploitation of any of these systems may cause a serious influence to our real life and appropriate countermeasures must be taken to mitigate the risks.

Particularly, a promising potential exists for enhanced efficiency and safety in applications such as autonomous transportation systems, control systems in critical infrastructures, smart manufacturing and process plants, robotics, and smart medical devices, among others. However, the modern features of CPSs are ambiguous for system designers and risk analysts, especially considering the role of humans and the interactions between safety and security. The sources of safety risks are not restricted to accidental failures and errors anymore. Indeed, cybersecurity attacks can now cascade into safety risks leading to physical harm to the system and its environment. These new challenges demand system engineers and risk analysts to understand the security vulnerabilities existing in CPS features and their dependencies with physical processes. Therefore, this paper (a) examines the key features of CPSs and their relation with other system types; (b) defines the dependencies between levels of automation and human roles in CPSs from a systems engineering perspective; and (c) applies systems thinking to describe a multi-layered diagrammatic representation of CPSs for combined safety and security risk analysis, demonstrating an application in the maritime sector to analyze an autonomous surface vehicle. © 2019 The Authors.

It is then essential to understand what are the defense mechanisms that can be used as a first line of defense. For this purpose, this article will firstly study the spectrum of attack vectors that APTs can use against existing and novel elements of an industrial ecosystem. Afterwards, this article will provide an analysis of the evolution and applicability of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) that have been proposed in both the industry and academia. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","APT; Industrial control; Industry 4.0; Intrusion detection; SCADA","Ecosystems; Industry 4.0; Intrusion detection; Attack vector; Cyber defense; Defense mechanism; Industrial control systems; Industrial controls; Industrial ecosystems; Intrusion Detection Systems; SCADA; Network security","Adamsky, F., Aubigny, M., Battisti, F., Carli, M., Cimorelli, F., Cruz, T., Giorgio, A.D., Soua, R., Integrated Protection of Industrial Control Systems from Cyber-attacks: the ATENA Approach (2018) Int.

Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review of 119 papers published in journals included in the Journal Citation Report (JCR) was conducted to identify Industry 4.0 technologies. A descriptive analysis characterizes the corpus, and a content analysis identifies the technologies. Findings: The content analysis identified 111 technologies. These technologies perform four functions related to data: data generation and capture, data transmission, data conditioning, storage and processing and data application. The first three groups consist of enabling technologies and the fourth group of value-creating technologies. Results show that Industry 4.0 publications focus on enabling technologies that transmit and process data. Value-creating technologies, which apply data in order to develop new solutions, are still rare in the literature. Research limitations/implications: The proposed framework serves as a structure for analysing the focus of publications over time, and enables the classification of new technologies as the paradigm evolves. Practical implications: Because the technical side of the new production paradigm is complex and represents an evolving field, managers benefit from a simplified and data-driven approach. The proposed framework suggests that Industry 4.0 should be approached by looking at how data can create value and at what role each technology plays in this task. Originality/value: The study makes a direct link between Industry 4.0 technologies and the key resource of this revolution, i.e. data. It provides a rationale that not only establishes relationships between technologies and data, but also highlights their roles as enablers or creators of value. Beyond showing the current focus of Industry 4.0 publications, this paper proposes a framework that is useful for tracking the evolution of the paradigm. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Digitization; Industry 4.0; Technology","Analog to digital conversion; Digital storage; Industry 4.0; Publishing; Current technology; Data application; Data-driven approach; Descriptive analysis; Design/methodology/approach; Enabling technologies; Journal citation reports; Systematic literature review; Data handling","Akter, S., Wamba, S.F., Gunasekaran, A., Dubey, R., Childe, S.J., How to improve firm performance using big data analytics capability and business strategy alignment?

In particular, in the field of power control systems, ICT technology such as industrial internet of things (IoT) is applied for efficient remote measurement. Therefore, legacy systems that were previously operated as standalone now have contact points with the external networks. In this trend, security vulnerabilities from legacy ICT have been inherited by power control systems. Therefore, various security technologies are being researched and developed to cope with cyber vulnerabilities and threats. However, it is risky to apply novel security technologies that are not verified as secure, to power control systems, the availability of which must be guaranteed to provide electricity consistently. Thus, verifying the effectiveness and stability of new security technologies is necessary to apply the technologies to power control systems. In this paper, we analyze the configuration and characteristics of the power control systems network, which is an area where industrial IoT technology is applied. We also build a testbed environment that can verify the security technology and conduct experiments to confirm the security technology for the power control system and the suitability of the testbed. The proposed testbed will be able to stably incorporate new security technologies into the critical industrial infrastructure. Further, it is also expected that the security and stability of the system will be enhanced. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Industrial control system; Intrusion detection system;

Its complexity is increased by mutual relationships between different stakeholders involved in the creation, management and efficient exploitation of engineering data. Over the years, productivity and reliability in CI has been struggled by a difficulty in sharing information between construction project participants and in providing accurate information on site, which is a primary cause of poor performances. Therefore, the adoption of enabling tools for managing product data and information flow as well as for better communication and collaboration appears crucial in the CI. This paper describes an approach to achieve significant improvements in managing of construction activities, thanks to the adoption of ICT technologies for the immediate information delivery. In particular, this research paper will describe the developing process of a digital platform that uses augmented reality combined with BIM to provide workers with relevant information in real-time, based on their current position on the construction site. This consists in a 3D model-based integration platform that can integrate and exploit BIM models, in order to provide context-aware “augmented” information in real-time at the right place. The paper describes the main features of the developed tool and focuses on the actual topics of the study which are: (1) the location system using sensory information collected by mobile devices to give location awareness to the application; (2) the integration of 3D BIM model metadata in order to contextualize tasks and instructions and provide building components information. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2018.","3D model-based platform; Augmented reality; BIM metadata; Industry 4.0; Product development","Architectural design; Augmented reality; Construction industry; Industry 4.0; Integration; Life cycle; Metadata; Product development; Supply chains; Three dimensional computer graphics; 3-d modeling; Communication and collaborations; Construction activities; Construction process; Construction projects; Information delivery; Information-on site; Sharing information; Information management","Dainty, A., Moore, D., Murray, M., (2006) Communication in Construction, Theory and Practice, , Taylor & Francis, New York; Tauscher, E., Mikulakova, E., Beucke, K., König, M., Automated generation of construction schedules based on the IFC object model (2009) International Workshop on Computing in Civil Engineering, pp. 666-675. , https://doi.org/10.1061/41052(346)66, ASCE, Austin; Chi, H.-L., Kang, C.-C., Wang, X., Research trends and opportunities of augmented reality applications in architecture, engineering, and construction (2013) Autom.

In particular, the move from centralized towards distributed power generation significantly increases the demand for ICT-based management and control. Today ICT-based energy management is mostly purely central, making the critical infrastructure of power supply sometimes inflexible and potentially vulnerable to (cyber-)attacks. Addressing these challenges, the future grid requires high automation and distributed intelligence on field level being able to work independently from a central system. Distribution grids are often sparsely monitored and a system wide upgrade of measuring technology is associated with high costs. However, information about load behavior at the nodes of a grid is essential for grid state identification and load forecasting. This paper shows the concept of load balancing and the related IT architecture for monitoring and control of distributed energy systems, where smart metering and smart home technologies play a key role in the smart grid of the future.

With the advent of the fourth industrial revolution and the IoE era, industrial control systems (ICSs) are transitioning into industrial IoE (IIoE). The ICS, which is no longer a closed network, suffers from various cybersecurity threats. Since the attack of Stuxnet in 2010, the malware used to attack critical infrastructure (CI) has become increasingly sophisticated. Furthermore, recent attacks have mimicked normal network traffic. Therefore, investigating intrusion detection systems is necessary to detect these advanced cyberattacks. However, detecting advanced attacks, such as false data injection, is difficult because the traditional detection methods focus only on the protocol header fields. Most studies have not considered low-performance field devices, which are vulnerable to threats. Therefore, we have classified the extended reference model RAMI 4.0, which is the new ICS reference model in the fourth industrial revolution, into two levels: an operative level and a product process management level. A fast and lightweight algorithm is required at the operative level because the low-performance devices communicate with each other in real time. In addition, efficient data processing is important because considerable amount of data is concentrated at the product process management level. Based on these characteristics, a payload-based abnormal behavior detection method, i.e., the autoencoder-based payload anomaly detection (APAD), is proposed for each level. APAD uses an autoencoder to distinguish between normal and abnormal behaviors in low-performance devices. Furthermore, traffic analysis and a considerable amount of time are required to apply a traditional detection method at the product process management level. However, the proposed method does not require long-time traffic analysis. It exhibits a higher detection rate compared with those exhibited by other methods based on verification using the open secure water treatment dataset called SWaT. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","False data injection; Industrial control system; Industrial IoE; Network anomaly detection; Security with deep learning","Control systems; Deep learning; Industry 4.0; Intrusion detection; Malware; Water treatment; Abnormal behavior detections; False data injection; Industrial control systems; Industrial IoE; Industrial revolutions; Intrusion Detection Systems; Network anomaly detection; Reference modeling; Anomaly detection","ICS-CERT, Year in Review (2019), https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/Annual_Reports/Year_in_Review_FY2016_Final_S508C.pdf, (Accessed 07 June 2019); Soheily-Khah, S., Marteau, P.-F., Béchet, N., Intrusion detection in network systems through hybrid supervised and unsupervised machine learning process: A case study on the ISCX dataset (2018) 2018 1st International Conference on Data Intelligence and Security, ICDIS, , IEEE; Parwez, M.S., Rawat, D.B., Garuba, M., Big data analytics for user-activity analysis and user-anomaly detection in mobile wireless network (2017) IEEE Trans.

In this context, ""Smart Services"" describe data-based, individually configurable bundles of physically delivered services, digital services as well as physical products, which are usually performed on integrated platforms. Due to their complexity and the integration of data from customers and other stakeholders as a key resource for value creation, Smart Services are performed in complex Ecosystems (e.g. in collaboration between technology, software as well as service specialists and users). However, Value Co-creation in Smart Service Ecosystems requires an adaption of stakeholderś existing business models. Smart Service platforms need to consider value contributions of other actors, when defining their business models and vice versa. Based on the use case of Smart City Services our paper illustrates the need for developing Smart Service Business Models collaboratively between ecosystem stakeholders and provides insights about appropriate methods for doing so. © 2017 PICMET.",,"Ecology; Industry 4.0; Business models; Collaborative development; Complex ecosystems; Digital services; Integrated platform; Physical products; Service sectors; Value co creations; Ecosystems","Herterich, M.M., Uebernickel, F., Brenner, W., (2016) Industrielle Dienstleistungen 4.0, , Wiesbaden: Springer; (2015) Smart Service Welt - Recommendations for the Strategic Initiative Web-based Services for Businesses.

Though there have been extensive studies on infrastructures from the perspective of cyber security, insufficient research has been conducted from a practical viewpoint of cyber-physical security. In this paper, we focus on train control systems as one of the critical infrastructures. We fully investigate the emerging de facto standard of train control systems, communication-based train control (CBTC). We analyze the cyber-physical vulnerability of CBTC and discover that a man-in-the-middle attack combined with knowledge on train signaling can cause train collisions in CBTC. To resolve the issue, we propose a countermeasure for resiliency of CBTC. By implementing a realistic CBTC testbed, we validate our analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth empirical study on cyber-physical vulnerability of CBTC systems. © 2014 IEEE.","Communication-based train control; cyber-physical security; cyber-physical systems; real-time IoT; vulnerability analysis","Control systems; Electric power transmission networks; Embedded systems; Internet of things; Man machine systems; Network security; Railroad traffic control; Real time systems; Signaling; Communication-based train controls; Cyber-Physical securities; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Man in the middle attacks; Real time; Real time information exchange; Real time performance; Vulnerability analysis; Cyber Physical System","Park, K.-J., Zheng, R., Liu, X., Cyber-physical systems: Milestones and research challenges (2012) Comput.

Hybrid threats, economic crises, social inequalities, and labor migration are among the main challenges of global security. What are possible manifestations of disruptive technology in national security interest in the broader sense? Is it possible timely to identify and react to threats to competitivness, ""job killer"" or law system? Critical infrastructure are parameter, which identifies assets or system as element of security. Topic reveal interaction between disruptive technology and critical infrastructure in the context of national security.

One result of that property could be that it is easier to reconfigure plants for different products which is, in times of a high rate of variant diversity, a very important point. Nowadays in typical robot based plants, a huge part of time from the commissioning process is needed for the programming of collision free paths. This mainly includes the teach-in or offline programming (OLP) and the optimization of the paths. To speed up this process significantly, an automatic and intelligent planning system is necessary. In this work we present a system which can plan paths for industrial robots.

Due to the ever-increasing number of Internet-connected Internet-of-Things (IoT)/Industrial IoT (IIoT), and the high volume of data generated and collected, security and scalability are becoming burning concerns for critical infrastructures in industry 4.0. The blockchain technology is essentially a distributed and secure ledger that records all the transactions into a hierarchically expanding chain of blocks. Edge computing brings the cloud capabilities closer to the computation tasks. The convergence of blockchain and edge computing paradigms can overcome the existing security and scalability issues. In this article, we first introduce the IoT/IIoT critical infrastructure in industry 4.0, and then we briefly present the blockchain and edge computing paradigms. After that, we show how the convergence of these two paradigms can enable secure and scalable critical infrastructures. Then, we provide a survey on the state of the art for security and privacy and scalability of IoT/IIoT critical infrastructures. A list of potential research challenges and open issues in this area is also provided, which can be used as useful resources to guide future research. © 2014 IEEE.","Blockchain; critical infrastructure; edge computing; Industry 40; Internet of Things (IoT)","Blockchain; Edge computing; Industrial internet of things (IIoT); Industry 4.0; Public works; Scalability; Computation tasks; Computing paradigm; Critical infrastructure systems; Internet of Things (IOT); Potential researches; Scalability issue; Security and privacy; State of the art; Critical infrastructures","Wang, T., Big data reduction for a smart city's critical infras-tructural health monitoring (2018) Ieee Commun.

The country has motivated manufactures to focus on smart manufacturing considering the sustainable development aspects to develop circular economy capabilities. However, manufacturers are facing various resource related challenges, which has slowed down the progress of Industry 4.0 adoption. This study aspires to develop a theoretical model linking key resources for Industry 4.0 adoption that are essential to drive technological progress; and its effect on sustainable production and circular economy capabilities. The review of literature led to the identification of thirty-five resources that are essential for the adoption of Industry 4.0. Further, exploratory factor analysis was used to group the variables under relevant factors and thereafter research team developed a theoretical model that was further tested using PLS-SEM technique. Research findings indicate that production systems, human resources, project management, management leadership, green logistics, green design, information technology, big data analytics and collaborative relationships are key resources for Industry 4.0 adoption; second, Industry 4.0 adoption have a positive relationship with sustainable production and finally, sustainable production has a positive relationship with circular economy capabilities. The study concludes with theoretical and practical implications. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Ethical business development; Industry 4.0; Sustainable production; Sustainable resources","Advanced Analytics; Data Analytics; Developing countries; Digital storage; Factor analysis; Green manufacturing; Industry 4.0; Information management; Project management; Sustainable development; Collaborative relationships; Empirical studies; Exploratory factor analysis; Smart manufacturing; Sustainable production; Technological innovation; Technological progress; Theoretical modeling; Industrial economics","Armstrong, J.S., Overton, T.S., Estimating nonresponse bias in mail surveys (1977) J.

In this study, we set out an estimation framework designed to explore whether the spatial-temporal compression effect of HSR has paved the way for the Fourth Industrial Revolution characterized by urban technological innovation and whether HSR has strengthened the technology spillovers from venture capital (VC). The principal findings are as follows: First, the opening of HSR can strengthen urban technological performance, and compared with non-HSR cities, the number of patent applications is higher in HSR cities. Second, considering the heterogeneity of technological innovation, and the results show that the opening of HSR can significantly promote the breakthrough innovation and incremental innovation of cities, and has a more significant impact on the breakthrough innovation. Finally, VC has a highly significant and positive effect on urban technological performance. More notably, our findings suggest that the opening of HSR has a considerable shock effect on the technology spillovers from VC. This study has great practical significance for analyzing the impact of HSR on the transformation of the Fourth Industrial Revolution characterized by urban technological performance. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Fourth Industrial Revolution; High-speed rail (HSR); Urban technological performance; Venture capital (VC)","Economics; Industry 4.0; Investments; Patents and inventions; Railroad transportation; Breakthrough innovations; Incremental innovation; Industrial revolutions; Patent applications; Spatial temporals; Technological innovation; Technological performance; Technology spillovers; Economic and social effects; economic growth; estimation method; high-speed train; industrialization; innovation; railway transport; spillover effect; technological development; China","Alam, G.M., Forhad, A.R., Ismail, I.A., Can education as an ‘International Commodity'be the backbone or cane of a nation in the era of fourth industrial revolution?-A comparative study (2020) Technol.

Although digitalization has been used on the shop floor of modern factory for decades, some manufacturing operations remain manual and humans can perform these better than machines. Under such circumstances, a feasible solution is to have human operators collaborate with computational intelligence (CI) in real time through augmented reality (AR). This study conducts a systematic review of the recent literature on AR applications developed for smart manufacturing. A classification framework consisting of four facets, namely interaction device, manufacturing operation, functional approach, and intelligence source, is proposed to analyze the related studies. The analysis shows how AR has been used to facilitate various manufacturing operations with intelligence. Important findings are derived from a viewpoint different from that of the previous reviews on this subject. The perspective here is on how AR can work as a collaboration interface between human and CI. The outcome of this work is expected to provide guidelines for implementing AR assisted functions with practical applications in smart manufacturing in the near future. © 2020 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Augmented reality; Computational intelligence; Industry 4.0; Smart manufacturing","Augmented reality; Flow control; Intelligent computing; Classification framework; Functional approach; Intelligence sources; Interaction devices; Manufacturing operations; Mass customization; Smart manufacturing; Systematic literature review; Manufacture","Tao, W., Lai, Z.H., Leu, M.C., Yin, Z., Qin, R., A self-aware and active-guiding training & assistant system for worker-centered intelligent manufacturing (2019) Manuf Lett, 21, pp. 45-49; Schlagowski, R., Merkel, L., Meitinger, C., Design of an assistant system for industrial maintenance tasks and implementation of a prototype using augmented reality (2017) IEEE Int.

The difference to single improvement projects lies in the way the workforce is included in kaizen activities on an everyday basis. In a target-oriented CI approach the employees are also actively coached and guided by a leader (e.g. group or team leader) to act as a basis of the learning organization. The success and documentation of the improvement steps are therefore highly dependent on the skills of executives. Because of that, CI is currently being carried out in many companies either in a completely unstructured or in a traditional way with paper-based documentation. At that point digitalization concepts can support the effectiveness and efficiency of a CI system. The target of this paper lies in defining the core elements of a successful CI system and rating them against digitalization approaches which have been used in other parts of manufacturing. The compatibility of CI elements and digitalization approaches are rated with the help of the Delphi method. Following that, the concept of a digital CI is presented, which facilitates communication between managers and actual process improvers, documentation and employee learning during the improvement process. It is then compared to a traditional target-oriented CI process to show the major advantages and next steps in the introduction of such a system. © 2017 The Authors.

Making a CI developable and ruled has become a crucial technology to obviously improve machining efficiency and save costs although it may bring negative effects on aerodynamic performance accordingly. Hence, it is extremely challenging to consider and balance both machinability and aerodynamic performance in the process of CI geometric optimization. Digital Twin (DT) provides an attractive option for the integrated design and manufacturing due to multi-dimension and real-time. This paper breaks traditional procedures and presents a DT-based optimization strategy on the consideration of both machining efficiency and aerodynamic performance, as well as builds a reified 5-dimensional DT model. The virtual model consists of three sub-functional modules, including geometric modeling, machining optimization and aerodynamic performance evaluation. A tool-path generation method for CI five-axis flank milling is proposed to improve machining efficiency. The negative influences on aerodynamic performance and internal flow field are simulated and analyzed. Reinforce Learning is introduced to determine the optimization decision-making. Machining experiment and performance test with respect to various CI workpieces are conducted to provide immediate feedback to DT model. Real world and virtual world are combined to make CI geometry dynamically updated and iteratively optimized, which is desirable and significative to effectively shorten cycles and save costs in CI development. © 2020 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Aerodynamic optimization; Centrifugal impeller (CI); Digital twin (DT); Flank milling; Machining experiment; Performance test; Ruled-surface blade; Smart manufacturing","Aerodynamics; Centrifugation; Competition; Decision making; Digital twin; Efficiency; Impellers; Iterative methods; Machine tools; Manufacture; Milling (machining); Aero-dynamic performance; Centrifugal impeller; Geometric optimization; Machining efficiency; Machining experiments; Machining optimization; Optimization strategy; Tool path generation; Geometry","Ji, F., Zhang, X., Du, F., Ding, S., Zhao, Y., Experimental and numerical investigation on micro gas turbine as a range extender for electric vehicle (2020) Appl Therm Eng, 173 (6); Li, C., Wang, J., Guo, Z., Song, L., Li, J., Aero-mechanical multidisciplinary optimization of a high speed centrifugal impeller (2019) Aerosp.

Modern industrial devices in the control level are often communicating over proprietary protocols on top of TCP/IP with each other and SCADA systems. The networks in which the controllers operate are usually considered as trustworthy and thereby they are not properly secured. Due to the growing connectivity caused by the Internet of Things (IoT) and Industry 4.0 the security risks are rising. Therefore, the demand of security assessment tools for industrial networks is high. In this paper, we introduce a new fuzzing framework called PropFuzz, which is capable to fuzz proprietary industrial control system protocols and monitor the behavior of the controller.

This paper leverages the new Industry 4.0 design principles to cope with these new manufacturing requirements: (i) distributed auction-based coordination allows local decision-making and task allocation, (ii) distributed model predictive control-based transportation enables free space collision avoidance of automated guided vehicles (AGVs), and (iii) distributed vision-based localisation provides scalable and dynamic position information of key resources on the factory floor. Furthermore, these contributions are brought together in a lab-scale reconfigurable manufacturing system to showcase modularity and distributed decision-making at several levels of a manufacturing process' logistics. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Automatic guided vehicles;

However, scholars have not considered talent from the viewpoint of companies. We address this omission by using a multiple case method, including semi-structured interviews and document reviews, to analyse companies’ need for talent and its acquisition. We find that companies need talent in the areas of lean management, the Internet of things (IoT), cloud computing, and big data. Moreover, companies obtain talent using external resources such as strategic alliances, mergers and acquisitions, and outsourcing. We also establish that Industry 4.0 implementation does not affect job numbers; however, companies must adjust their talent development practices.

The development of CPS mostly needs a unified methodology that permits efficient raise of the abstraction level to overcome issues of heterogeneity induced by the multidisciplinary nature of the system. Model-driven engineering (MDE) is believed to be an alternative solution to overcome the challenges faced while developing CPS. This paper presents a systematic mapping study on using the MDE paradigm in CPS development and management. 140 research papers published during the period 2010–2018 are evaluated. The study mainly enables to find out the followed approaches when applying MDE for CPS, addressed CPS challenges, application domains and presented case studies. Results showed that the number of publications in this field is continuously increasing in recent years. Results also showed that metamodeling and model-based approaches are mostly adopted by the researchers affiliated to Europe, while DSL-based approach is adopted mostly by USA affiliated researchers. Only 45% of the studies consider a specific CPS application domain in which Smart Manufacturing is the most addressed domain followed by Critical Infrastructure, Health Care and Medicine. Moreover, the majority of the studies present case studies as the main evaluation method for the proposed MDE solutions. Conducting empirical evaluations is mostly missing. The results also revealed that various CPS challenges are addressed, and the most addressed ones are the complexity and interoperability aspects of CPS. Reporting on what previous researches have accomplished, as well as current research efforts and open challenges related to this field can guide researchers and developers in their further work on CPS design and implementation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS); Model-Driven Engineering (MDE); Systematic Mapping Study","Cyber Physical System; Engineering research; Mapping; Alternative solutions; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Empirical evaluations; Model based approach; Model-driven Engineering; Smart manufacturing; Systematic mapping studies; Unified methodology; Embedded systems","Lee, E.A., The past, present and future of cyber-physical systems: A focus on models (2015) Sensors, 15 (3), pp. 4837-4869; Lee, E.A., Cyber physical systems: Design challenges (2008) 2008 11th IEEE International Symposium on Object and Component-Oriented Real-Time Distributed Computing (ISORC), pp. 363-369. , IEEE; Lee, E.A., Fundamental limits of cyber-physical systems modeling (2016) ACM Trans.

Two of the main challenges arising in the current Internet Of Things scenarios, i.e., the Smart Building one, are, on one side, the requirement of interconnecting several heterogeneous platforms and smart Things in the same environment and, on the other side, the need to be able to evolve the complex software ecosystem deployed, reacting automatically and at runtime to environmental changes, without the human intervention. To address these challenges, BRAIN-IoT establishes a framework and methodology supporting smart cooperative behaviour in fully de-centralized, composable and dynamic federations of heterogeneous Internet of Things platforms. In this way, BRAIN-IoT enables smart autonomous behaviour in Internet of Things scenarios, involving heterogeneous sensors and actuators autonomously cooperating to execute complex, dynamic tasks. Furthermore, BRAIN-IoT enables dynamically deploying and orchestrating distributed applications, allowing the automatic installation and replacement of smart behaviours reacting to environmental changes and User events. Finally, BRAIN-IoT provides a set of components that guarantee the security and privacy protection of the data exchanged using the solution. BRAIN-IoT is a general purpose solution that aims at being adaptable for heterogeneous scenarios, from Service Robotics to Critical Infrastructure Management. This paper introduces a Smart Building use case of the solution, which allows highlighting the advantages given by BRAIN-IoT in such scenario. © 2019 IEEE.","BRAIN-IoT; Complex Adaptive Systems; IoT platforms; IoT System Behavior Modeling; Privacy Impact Assessment","Application programs; Behavioral research; Ecosystems; Electronic data interchange; Geographical distribution; Complex adaptive systems; Distributed applications; Heterogeneous platforms; Impact assessments; Infrastructure managements; IoT platforms; Security and privacy protection; System behaviors; Internet of things","James Manyika, P.B.J.W., Chui, M., Aharon, D., Unlocking the potential of the Internet of Things (2015) McKinsey Digital, Tech.

In the future, with Internet of Everything (IoE), every entity (people, machines, animals, cars, buildings, etc.) will have possibilities for direct interconnections. Forecasts show that over 20 billion connected devices will reach the market by 2020. Ninety percent of cars are expected to be connected, too. These wide range of industry and consumer applications have growing needs for IoT and many common elements such as decentralization, real-time requirements, sensory or measurement capabilities, a communications layer and Big Dataanalytics/intelligence. Besides these well know common elements, also in many applications exit the need for payment. This additional requirement is known as the idea of IoT payments.

Cascading effects of structural failures to other types of critical infrastructure have been evident by many recent cases, such as the Oroville dam incident, with substantial costs for asset owners, insurers and maintainers and significant disruption to civil society. Over the last two decades, there is an increasing trend that employs Information Communication Technology (ICT) and Operational Technology (OT) systems in industrial sectors to improve the maintenance of various systems. The transferability of such developments in civil infrastructure could enhance substantially their management and long-term structural resilience. This study aims to introduce this upcoming trend that is entitled Civil Infrastructure 4.0 (CI4.0) and primarily focuses on the Intelligent Asset Management. CI4.0 aims to enlarge the focus from the single structure to the infrastructure system perspective. The principles of CI4.0 are presented for smart infrastructure systems that enable to obtain real-time and forecasted insights by taking into account different key parameters (e.g. combination of climate risks, engineering and socio-economic parameters). The work will then focus on main aspects with regards to the interoperability and adaptive capabilities between structures towards enhancing the decision-making processes and the proactive asset management of civil infrastructure systems. © 2019, National Technical University of Athens.

As a consequence of this technological revolution, interconnection mechanisms are required to offer transparency in the connections and protection in the different application domains, without this implying a significant degradation of the control requirements. Therefore, this book chapter presents a reference architecture for Industry 4.0 where the interconnection core is mainly concentrated in the Policy Decision Points (PDP), which can be deployed in high volume data processing and storage technologies such as cloud and fog servers. Each PDP authorizes actions in the field/plant according to a set of factors (entities, context and risks) computed through the existing access control measures, such as RBAC+ABAC+Risk-BAC (Role/Attribute/Risk-Based Access Control, respectively), to establish coordinated and constrained accesses in extreme situations. Part of these actions also includes proactive risk assessment measures to respond to anomalies or intrusive threats in time. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",,,"Al-Fuqaha, A., Guizani, M., Mohammadi, M., Aledhari, M., Ayyash, M., Internet of things: A survey on enabling technologies, protocols, and applications (2015) IEEE Commun Surv Tutorials, 17 (4), pp. 2347-2376; Alcaraz, C., Resilient industrial control systems based on multiple redundancy (2017) Int J Crit Infrastruct (IJCIS), 13 (2-3), pp. 278-295; Alcaraz, C., Cloud-assisted dynamic resilience for cyber-physical control systems (2018) IEEE Wirel Commun, 25 (1), pp. 76-82; Alcaraz, C., Cazorla, L., Fernandez, G., Context-awareness using anomaly-based detectors for smart grid domains (2015) 9Th International Conference on Risks and Security of Internet and Systems, 8924, pp. 17-34. , vol, Springer, Trento, pp; Alcaraz, C., Fernandez-Gago, C., Lopez, J., An early warning system based on reputation for energy control systems (2011) IEEE Trans Smart Grid, 2 (4), pp. 827-834; Alcaraz, C., Lopez, J., A security analysis for wireless sensor mesh networks in highly critical systems (2010) IEEE Trans Syst Man Cybern Part C Appl Rev, 40 (4), pp. 419-428; Alcaraz, C., Lopez, J., Analysis of requirements for critical control systems (2012) Int J Crit Infrastruct Prot (IJCIP), 5, pp. 137-145; Alcaraz, C., Lopez, J., Wide-area situational awareness for critical infrastructure protection (2013) IEEE Comput, 46 (4), pp. 30-37; Alcaraz, C., Lopez, J., Secure interoperability in cyber-physical systems (2017) Security Solutions and Applied Cryptography in Smart Grid Communications, Chap 8, pp. 137-158. , IGI Global, USA, pp; Alcaraz, C., Lopez, J., Choo, K.K.R., Resilient interconnection in cyber-physical control systems (2017) Comput Secur, 71, pp. 2-14; Alcaraz, C., Lopez, J., Wolthusen, S., Policy enforcement system for secure interoperable control in distributed smart grid systems (2016) J Netw Comput Appl, 59, pp. 301-314; Alcaraz, C., Zeadally, S., Critical control system protection in the 21st century (2013) Threats and Solutions.

The Systems Modeling Language (SysML) represents a significant and increasing segment of industrial support for the development of cyber-physical systems partly due to the language's built-in mechanisms for modeling the requirements. In this paper, we leverage goal-oriented obstacle analysis to systematically identify the impediments to the fulfillment of requirements, and further examine several machine learning algorithms' capabilities of classifying these impediments into the components that constitute the cyber physical systems. We then investigate the extent to which a state-of-the-practice SysML tool simulates these obstacles, thereby assessing the risks of system failures at the requirements level. Our work offers concrete insights into model testing which incorporates the deep intertwining of software with hardware in order to improve the robustness of the cyber-physical systems. © 2018 IEEE.","Cyber-physical systems; KAOS; Machine learning; Obstacle analysis; System modeling language (SysML)","Cyber Physical System; Electric power transmission networks; Embedded systems; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine components; Machine learning; Modeling languages; Requirements engineering; Risk assessment; Software testing; Systems engineering; Technical presentations; Industrial supports; KAOS; Obstacle analysis; State of the practice; System failures; System Modeling Language (SysML); Systems modeling languages; Technological revolution; Electric power system control","Suh, S.C., Tanik, U.J., Carbone, J.N., Eroglu, A., (2014) Applied Cyber-Physical Systems, , Springer; Systems Modeling Language (SysML), , http://www.omgsysml.org, Last accessed: June 2018; Schäfer, W., Wehrheim, H., The challenges of building advanced mechatronic systems (2007) International Conference on the Future of Software Engineering (FOSE), pp. 72-84. , Minneapolis, MN, USA, May; Sabetzadeh, M., Nejati, S., Briand, L.C., Mills, A.-H.E., Using SysML for modeling of safety-critical software-hardware interfaces: Guidelines and industry experience (2011) International Symposium on High-Assurance Systems Engineering (HASE), pp. 193-201. , Boca Raton, FL, USA, November; Cameo Systems Modeler MagicDraw, , https://www.nomagic.com/products/cameo-systems-modeler, No Magic Last accessed: June 2018.

CPS is a broad area of engineering which supports applications across emergency response, air transportation, critical infrastructure, health care and medicine, intelligent transportation, robotic for service, and special smart manufacturing. In particular, CPS is the core technology enabling the transition from Industry 3.0 to Industry 4.0 and is transforming global advanced manufacturing. This paper provides a review of CPS 5 components architecture for manufacturing as well as of CPS components challenges for manufacturing.

The key observation is that IIoT devices are available in large quantities in critical infrastructure (e.g., micro-grids, water management and treatment, energy generation and transmission, manufacturing, buildings, and traffic) but are often underutilized due to the conservative allocation of resources, static task assignment, and lack of exploitation of parallelism that is intrinsic in redundant hardware. Dispersed Automation can give new life to IIoT devices, some of them as powerful as general-purpose computers, and can make them accessible for the co-execution of various computational workloads while dynamically adapting to different applications and operational environments. Two key technical innovations will make this possible: the use of a domain-specific language, and on-channel computation. This paper shows how Dispersed Automation can be an enabling technology for the implementation of smart manufacturing systems. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Critical infrastructures; General purpose computers; Internet of things; Manufacture; Problem oriented languages; Public works; Water treatment; Advanced manufacturing; Computational workload; Domain specific languages; Enabling technologies; General-purpose computations; Industrial internets; Operational environments; Technical innovation; Automation","Faruque, M.A.A., Dalloro, L., Zhou, S., Ludwig, H., Lo, G., Managing residential-level EV charging using network-asautomation platform (NAP) technology (2012) IEEE Intl.

Following popular trends, modern industrial control systems are incorporating technologies such as Industry 4.0, Internet of Things and cloud computing. In these architectures, traditional information and communications hardware and software are glued together with physical components and modern technologies based on IP networks such as software defined networking. The ability of these systems to respond and reconfigure themselves to mitigate faults and attacks is immensely attractive. This chapter proposes a three-tier architecture that implements response and reconfiguration capabilities in an industrial control system. It adopts a software defined network tier for dynamic communications flow (re)configuration and whitelisting, an application tier for the optimal placement of anomaly detection systems and a supervision tier for gluing the three tiers together. The effectiveness and performance of the protection mechanism are demonstrated via use case based qualitative and quantitative assessments. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2017.","Industrial control systems; Security; Software defined networking","Application programs; Client server computer systems; Computer architecture; Control systems; Critical infrastructures; Gluing; Public works; Software defined networking; Anomaly detection systems; Industrial control systems; Information and communication; Network re-configuration; Qualitative and quantitative assessments; Reconfiguration capability; Security; System-of-systems architecture; Network architecture","Ackerman, R., (2014) Software-Defined Networking Looms as Next Big Technology, , Signal, May 12; (2017) Prescriptive Analytics and Supply Chain Management, , AIMMS, Bellevue, Washington (aimms.com; Anderson, R., Hundley, R., (1998) The Implications of COTS Vulnerabilities for the Dod and Critical U.S. Infrastructures: What Can/Should the Dod Do?, , P-8031, RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, California; Barbosa, R., Sadre, R., Pras, A., Flow whitelisting in SCADA networks (2013) International Journal of Critical Infrastructure Protection, 6 (3-4), pp. 150-158; Byres, E., (2012) Using ANSI/ISA-99 Standards to Improve Control System Security, , Version 1.1, White Paper, Tofino Security, Lantzville, Canada; Caselli, M., Zambon, E., Amann, J., Sommer, R., Kargl, F., Specification mining for intrusion detection in networked control systems (2016) Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth USENIX Security Symposium, pp. 791-806; Cherepanov, A., (2016) Blackenergy by the Sshbeardoor: Attacks against Ukrainian News Media and Electric Industry, , WeLiveSecurity, January 3; Combita, L., Giraldo, J., Cardenas, A., Quijano, N., Response and reconfiguration of cyber-physical control systems: A survey (2015) Proceedings of the Second IEEE Colombian Conference on Automatic Control; Dorsch, N., Kurtz, F., Georg, H., Hagerling, C., Wietfeld, C., Softwaredefined networking for smart grid communications: Applications, challenges and advantages (2014) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications, pp. 422-427; Drath, R., Horch, A., Industrie 4.0: Hit or hype?

However, cloud-based firms, who establish their businesses on cloud platforms, have received scant attention in the extant operations management (OM) literature. To narrow this gap, the purpose of this paper is to investigate cloud-based firms from an operations strategy perspective. Design/methodology/approach: A two-phase multi-method approach was adopted. In the first phase, content analysis of 27 reports from cloud-based firms was conducted, aided by text mining keyword extraction. Two data-related operations capabilities were identified and hypotheses were posited regarding the relationships between data resources (DR), operations capabilities and firm growth (FG). In the second phase, a sample of 190 cloud-based firms was collected. Seemingly unrelated regression and bootstrapping method were employed to test the proposed hypotheses using the survey data. Findings: The content analysis indicates data as a key resource and both data processing capability and data transformational capability as critical operations capabilities of cloud-based firms. FG is regarded as a top priority in the cloud context. The regression results indicate that DR and the two capabilities contribute to the growth of cloud-based firms. Moreover, a follow-up bootstrapping analysis reveals that the mediating effects of the two capabilities vary between different types of FG. Originality/value: To the authors’ best knowledge, this is one of the first OM studies on cloud-based firms. This study extends the operations strategy literature by identifying and testing the key operations capabilities and priorities of cloud-based firms. It also provides insightful implications for industrial practitioners. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cloud computing; Cloud-based firm; Data processing capability; Data transformational capability;

Following this trend the industry is facing interoperability challenges between devices and systems, which origin in the market and technology fragmentation of the past years. However, established integration techniques from the IoT domain cannot be fully adapted in industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) environments due to stricter dependability and real time constraints. Since design patterns offer a practical means to gain a deeper understanding of the problem domain, patterns are applied in this paper to develop a software architecture that is suitable for the deployment in the upcoming IIoT environments. The resulting software architecture combines ideas from the IoT world, industrial automation systems, as well as modern information technology (IT) and cloud architectures. Its lightweight and flexible design, along with the support of state-of-the-art development approaches (containerization, continuous integration (CI), continuous deployment (CD)) make the architecture equally suitable for the deployment on cloud, fog and edge devices. All in all, these features facilitate the deployment of services and communication protocols on device level, to enable the transparent and automatic integration of heterogenous devices and protocols, on demand. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

A paradigm shift is towards 'Industry 4.0' (i4) aiming at realising mass customisation at a mass production cost. However, there is a lack of tools for customer informatics. This paper addresses this issue and develops a predictive analytics framework integrating big data analysis and business informatics, using Computational Intelligence (CI). In particular, a fuzzy c-means is used for pattern recognition, as well as managing relevant big data for feeding potential customer needs and wants for improved productivity at the design stage for customised mass production. The selection of patterns from big data is performed using a genetic algorithm with fuzzy c-means, which helps with clustering and selection of optimal attributes. The case study shows that fuzzy c-means are able to assign new clusters with growing knowledge of customer needs and wants. The dataset has three types of entities: specification of various characteristics, assigned insurance risk rating, and normalised losses in use compared with other cars. The fuzzy c-means tool offers a number of features suitable for smart designs for an i4 environment. © 2016 IEEE.","big data analytics; fuzzy clustering; genetic search; Industry 4.0; smart design; Smart manufacturing","Application programs; Design; Fuzzy clustering; Fuzzy systems; Genetic algorithms; Industry 4.0; Information management; Pattern recognition; Predictive analytics; Sales; Big Data Analytics; Business informatics; Clustering and selections; Genetic search; Mass customisation; Mass production; Potential customers; Smart manufacturing; Big data","Kang, H.S., Smart manufacturing: Past research, present findings, and future directions (2016) International Journal of Precision Engineering and Manufacturing-Green Technology, 3 (1), pp. 111-128; Kull, H., Intelligent manufacturing technologies (2015) Mass Customization: Opportunities, Methods, and Challenges for Manufacturers, pp. 9-20. , Apress: Berkeley, CA; Flores, S.A.A., Self-organizing tool for smart design with predictive customer needs and wants to realize Industry 4. 0 (2016) World Congress on Computational Intelligence, , Vancouver, Canada: IEEE; Kull, H., Introduction (2015) Mass Customization: Opportunities, Methods, and Challenges for Manufacturers, pp. 1-6. , Apress: Berkeley, CA; Möller, D.P.F., Digital manufacturing/industry 4. 0 (2016) Guide to Computing Fundamentals in Cyber-Physical Systems: Concepts, Design Methods, and Applications, pp. 307-375. , Springer International Publishing: Cham; Yang, B., Burns, N., Implications of postponement for the supply chain (2003) International Journal of Production Research, 41 (9), pp. 2075-2090; Flores, S.A.A., Identifying smart design attributes for industry 4. 0 customization using a clustering genetic algorithm (2016) International Conference on Automation &Computing, , University of Essex, Colchester city, UK: IEEE; Lee, J., Recent advances and trends in predictive manufacturing systems in big data environment (2013) Manufacturing Letters, 1 (45), pp. 38-41; Lee, J., Bagheri, B., Kao, H.-A., A cyber-physical systems architecture for industry 4. 0-based manufacturing systems (2015) Manufacturing Letters, 3, pp. 18-23; Mühlhäuser, M., Smart Products: An Introduction (2008) Constructing Ambient Intelligence: AmI 2007 Workshops Darmstadt, Germany, November 7-10, 2007 Revised Papers, pp. 158-164. , M.

CPS constitute the backbone of enterprise (e.g., smart cities), industrial (e.g., smart manufacturing), and critical infrastructure (e.g., energy systems). Thus, their vital importance, interoperability, and plurality of computing devices make them prominent targets for malicious attacks aiming to disrupt their operations. Attacks targeting cyber-physical energy systems (CPES), given their mission-critical nature within the power grid infrastructure, can lead to disastrous consequences. The security of CPES can be enhanced by leveraging testbed capabilities in order to replicate and understand power systems operating conditions, discover vulnerabilities, develop security countermeasures, and evaluate grid operation under fault-induced or maliciously constructed scenarios. Adequately modeling and reproducing the behavior of CPS could be a challenging task. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the CPS security landscape with an emphasis on CPES. Specifically, we demonstrate a threat modeling methodology to accurately represent the CPS elements, their interdependencies, as well as the possible attack entry points and system vulnerabilities. Leveraging the threat model formulation, we present a CPS framework designed to delineate the hardware, software, and modeling resources required to simulate the CPS and construct high-fidelity models that can be used to evaluate the system's performance under adverse scenarios. The system performance is assessed using scenario-specific metrics, while risk assessment enables the system vulnerability prioritization factoring the impact on the system operation. The overarching framework for modeling, simulating, assessing, and mitigating attacks in a CPS is illustrated using four representative attack scenarios targeting CPES. The key objective of this paper is to demonstrate a step-by-step process that can be used to enact in-depth cybersecurity analyses, thus leading to more resilient and secure CPS. © 2013 IEEE.","Cyber-physical systems; power grid; risk assessment; security; simulation; testbeds; threat modeling","Critical infrastructures; Cyber Physical System; Electric power transmission networks; Embedded systems; Network security; Risk perception; Computational resources; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); High fidelity models; Operating condition; Physical environments; Security countermeasures; Smart manufacturing; System vulnerability; Risk assessment","(2020), https://www.nist.gov/el/cyber-physical-systems, NIST.

At the same time, traditional security systems fail to detect serious threats of increasing depth and duration. Therefore, alternative, intelligent solutions should be used to detect anomalies in the operating parameters of the infrastructures concerned, while ensuring the anonymity and confidentiality of industrial information. Blockchain is an encrypted, distributed archiving system designed to allow for the creation of real-time log files that are unequivocally linked. This ensures the security and transparency of transactions. This research presents, for the first time in the literature, an innovative Blockchain Security Architecture that aims to ensure network communication between traded Industrial Internet of Things devices, following the Industry 4.0 standard and based on Deep Learning Smart Contracts. The proposed smart contracts are implementing (via computer programming) a bilateral traffic control agreement to detect anomalies based on a trained Deep Autoencoder Neural Network. This architecture enables the creation of a secure distributed platform that can control and complete associated transactions in critical infrastructure networks, without the intervention of a single central authority.

The outset of the study is based on empirical data collected from five manufacturing companies, and proposes an initial model for ZDM with an Industry 4.0 perspective. The initial ZDM model has a generic setup for a real-life system and its replication as a digital twin using system models based on a representation of a generic production process with its connected control system, and potential interconnections between unit processes. It is based on concepts from system theory of dynamic systems and principles from condition monitoring and fault detection. In that way the model is deemed as highly generalizable for manufacturing and process industry companies as well as for some critical infrastructures with production and distribution systems. The proposed model with its cost function setup is analyzed and discussed in the context of ZDM. It is concluded that production processes in the manufacturing and process industry can be made more intelligent and interoperable using this approach. Improved sustainability, competitiveness, efficiency and profitability of companies are foreseen welcomed secondary effects. Finally, the proposed ZDM model further develops the ZDM by adding to it a systematic approach based on a solid mathematical foundation. © 2020 by the authors.","Digital twin; Industry 4.0; Intelligent; Model; Sustainable; System model; Zero defect manufacturing (ZDM)",,"Deming, W.E., Edwards, D.W., (1982) Quality, Productivity, and Competitive Position;, 183. , Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Center for Advanced Engineering Study: Cambridge, MA, USA; Psarommatis, F., May, G., Dreyfus, P.A., Kiritsis, D., Zero defect manufacturing: State-of-the-art review, shortcomings and future directions in research (2020) Int.

One of the key enablers for Industry 4.0 lies on reliable and timely exchange of information and large scale deployment of wireless communications in industry facilities. Wireless will bring solutions to overcome the main drawbacks of the current wired systems: lack of mobility, deployment costs, cable damage dependency and scalability. However, the strict requirements in reliability and latency of use cases such as Factory Automation (FA) and Process Automation (PA) are still a major challenge and a barrier for massive deployment of currently available wireless standards. This paper proposes a PHY/MAC wireless communication solution for FA and PA based on Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) in combination with the 802.11n standard. The communication system proposed aims at delivering two different sets of services. The first service class is composed of Critical Services (CS) with strict restrictions in reliability and latency. The same communication system should convey also a second group of services, referred as Best Effort (BE) with more relaxed boundary conditions. The proposal theoretical background, a detailed transmission-reception architecture, the physical layer performance and the MAC level system reliability are presented in this paper. The solution provides significantly better reliability and higher flexibility than TDMA systems, jointly with a predictable control-cycle latency.

This is also reflected in the creation of today's cyber-attacks. Following early 1960, industrial process control has been applied by electric systems. In the mid-1970s, the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) emerged, describing the automated control and data acquisition. Considering most industrial and automation networks were physically isolated, security was not an issue. This modified when in the early 2000s industrial networks were opened to the public internet. The reasons were manifold. Increased interconnectivity led to more productivity, simplicity, and ease of use. It decreased the configuration overhead and downtimes for system adjustments. However, it also led to an abundance of new attack vectors. For victorious cyberattacks are increasingly necessary in many cases, no more than a PC and an internet connection to strike a critical infrastructure like SCADA system. As for any trend, many cyber-physical attacks are targeting manufactories involving Industry 4.0 systems, like Maroochy Water Services in Australia, German Steel Mill Thyssenkrupp and Norsk Hydro Aluminum in 2000, 2014 and 2019, respectively. This paper describes these three cyberattacks in Industry 4.0, their different vulnerabilities, and proposes security measures to address the identified vulnerabilities. © 2019 IEEE.","cyber-attacks; cyber-physical; cyber-security; Industry 4.0; vulnerability","Aluminum alloys; Aluminum coated steel; Cyber Physical System; Embedded systems; Industry 4.0; Internet of things; Network security; SCADA systems; Service industry; Automation networks; Comparative studies; Industrial networks; Industrial process control; Interconnectivity; Internet connection; Maroochy water services; Supervisory control and data acquisition; Computer crime","Hermann, M., Pentek, T., Otto, B., Design principles for industrie 4. 0 scenarios (2016) Proceedings of the 49th Hawaii International Conference on IEEE System Sciences (HICSS), , Koloa, HI, USA, 5-8 January; Slay, J., Miller, M., Lessons learned from the maroochy water breach (2008) Proceeding of IFIP International Federation for Information Processing, 253, pp. 73-82. , Critical Infrastructure Protection, eds.

The evolution towards interconnection and interoperability has expanded the vulnerabilities of these systems, especially in the context of the widely spread legacy standard protocols, by exposing the data to the outside network. After gaining access to the system data by launching a variety of attacks, an intruder can cause severe damage to the industrial process in place. Hence, this paper attempts to respond to the security issue caused by legacy structures using insecure communication protocols (e.g., Modbus TCP, DNP3, S7), presenting a different perspective focused on the capabilities of a trusted platform module (TPM). Furthermore, the intent is to assure the authenticity of the data transmitted between two entities on the same (horizontal interoperation) or different (vertical interoperation) hierarchical levels communicating through Modbus TCP protocol based on functionalities obtained by integrating trusted platform modules. From the experimental results perspective, the paper aims to show the advantages of integrating TPMs in automation/SCADA systems in terms of security. Two methods are proposed in order to assure the authenticity of the messages which are transmitted, respectively the study presents the measurements related to the increased time latency introduced due to the proposed concept. © 2019 by the authors.

Therefore, in all these major infrastructures, closed networks are constructed to cut off the attack path. However, owing to the emergence of cloud, Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI) services, network interconnection is rapidly increasing; thus, many major infrastructure networks can no longer be called closed networks. The ICS, which was previously a strictly closed network, is now usually called Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and exhibits many changes, such as smart factories and remote control. Many payment modules use the financial network through IoT or AI-assisted services. In this massive connected environment, the existing closed network defense system may cause difficulties in providing the service. Therefore, there is a need for technology that can continuously monitor the possibility of advanced attacks. In this paper, we define the normal-behavior-based rules from the perspective of network forensics and conduct visualization studies to detect all possible attacks against the control protocol DNP3 (Distributed Network Protocol) and the financial protocol called FIX (Finance Information Exchange). Thus, we detected suspicious network packets on the ICS network and the financial network and identified abnormal behavior that could be the basis of serious attacks. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","DNP3; Financial network; FIX; Industrial control system; Network forensics; Visualization","Control systems; Finance; Flow visualization; Intelligent control; Interconnection networks (circuit switching); Internet of things; Network protocols; Remote control; Visualization; Distributed network protocols; DNP3; Financial networks; Industrial control systems; Infrastructure networks; Internet of Things (IOT); Network defense systems; Network interconnections; Digital forensics","(2001) Financial Information Exchange Protocol (FIX) Version 4.3; (2017), https://d3js.org/, d3 library; (2017), http://www.fixtradingcommunity.org/pg/main/who-uses-fix/fix-version; (2017) Fix Protocol South Korea Community, , http://koreafix.egloos.com; Abdullah, K., (2005) IDS Rainstorm: Visualizing IDS Alarms, 1; Abeyrathne, K.B., (2009) Visualization Tool for Network Forensics Analysis Using an Intrusion Detection System, 3. , CYBERVIZ; Ahmed, I., SCADA systems: challenges for forensic investigators (2012) Computer, 45, pp. 44-51; Angelini, M., Prigent, N., Santucci, G., Percival: Proactive and reactive attack and response assessment for cyberincidents using visual analytics (2015) Visualization for Cyber Security (VIZSEC), 2015 IEEE Symposium on IEEE; Arendt, D., CYBERPETRI at CDX 2016: Real-time network situation awareness (2016) Visualization for Cyber Security (VIZSEC), 2016 IEEE Symposium on IEEE; Blue, R., (2008) Visualizing Real-Time Network Resource Usage.

In order to enable interoperability and vertical integration of corporate management systems, these networks have evolved from formerly proprietary solutions to the application of Ethernet-based communication and internet standards. This development is accompanied by an increase in the number of threats. Although the most critical IT protection objective for automation systems is availability, usually no security mechanisms have been integrated into automation protocols. Also Ethernet offers no protection by design for these protocols. One of the most popular real-time protocols for industrial applications is Profinet IO. In this paper, we describe a Denial-of-Service attack on Profinet IO that exploits a vulnerability in the Discovery and Basic Configuration Protocol (DCP) which interrupts the Application Relationship between an IO Controller and an IO Device, and thus prevents the system from being repaired by the operator. The attack combines port stealing with the sending of forged DCP packets and causes a system downtime, which in affected production networks probably lead to a serious financial damage and, in case of critical infrastructures, even represents a high risk for the supply of society. We demonstrate the practical feasibility of the attack using realistic hardware and scenarios and discuss its significance for also other setups. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Industrial control systems; Profinet IO attacks; Profinet IO vulnerabilities","Automation; Denial-of-service attack; Ethernet; Malware; Network security; Application relationships; Automation protocols; Corporate management; Ethernet-based communications; Industrial control systems; PROFInet; Proprietary solutions; Vertical integration; Interoperability","Search Engine Shodan, , https://www.shodan.io, Accessed 05 Feb 2019; (2014) IEC 61158-6-10:2014: Industrial Communication Networks-Fieldbus Specifications-Part 6–10: Application Layer Protocol Specification-Type 10 Elements; (2014), IEC 61784–2:2014: Industrial communication networks-Profiles-Part 2: Additional fieldbus profiles for real-time networks based on ISO/IEC 8802–3; Akerberg, J., Bjorkman, M., Exploring security in Profinet IO 2009 33Rd Annual IEEE International Computer Software and Applications Conference, 1, pp. 406-412. , https://doi.org/10.1109/COMPSAC.2009.61, July 2009; Akerberg, J., Bjorkman, M., (2009) Introducing Security Modules in Profinet IO, , https://doi.org/10.1109/ETFA.2009.5347205; Baud, M., Felser, M., Profinet io-device emulator based on the man-in-the-middle attack (2006) 2006 IEEE Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automa-Tion, pp. 437-440. , https://doi.org/10.1109/ETFA.2006.355228, pp., September; Biondi, P., (2018) Packet Crafting for Python2 and Python3; Dias, A.L., Sestito, G.S., Turcato, A.C., Brandao, D., Panorama, challenges and opportunities in PROFINET protocol research 2018 13Th IEEE International Conference on Industry Applications (INDUSCON), , https://doi.org/10.1109/induscon.2018.8627173, IEEE, November 2018; Hui, H., McLaughlin, K., Investigating current plc security issues regarding siemens s7 communications and TIA portal (2018) 5Th International Symposium for ICS & SCADA Cyber Security Research 2018: Proceedings, pp. 67-73. , https://doi.org/10.14236/ewic/ICS2018.8, BCS, August; Liang, G., Weller, S.R., Zhao, J., Luo, F., Dong, Z.Y., The 2015 ukraine blackout: Implications for false data injection attacks (2017) IEEE Trans.

This is what the German government initiative, first, has identified with ‘Industry 4.0’. The manufacturing future will be marked and will go through the new automation technologies that are being introduced with Industrial Internet of Things (I2oT). Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) are exploiting I2oT for reducing costs and improving efficiency. However, ICSs are already jeopardized by an increasingly large set of threat vectors. Those threats are used by malicious actors to misuse physical Critical Infrastructures that usually are vital services for well-being. I2oT implementation increases the threat surface, generating new possible vulnerabilities. Information Technology (IT) classical approaches to cyber attacks cannot be applied to ICS due to their extreme differences from main priorities to resource constrains. Therefore, innovative approaches and equipment must be developed to suit with ICS world. In this paper, a Smart Behavioural Filter (SBF) for the PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) is proposed aiming to secure the PLC itself against logic attacks, that are stealth for other more classical security approaches. An example of the considered logic attacks is many open and close commands towards a valve in a short time. Those logic attacks are usually a sequence of well-formed packets in which the content represents an anomalous and unpredicted behaviour. This smart field equipment can react in short time to cyber attacks isolating the PLC, communicate with other equipment like itself and increasing in general the resilience of the physical system. It can also generate alarms for the local Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The proposed equipment has been developed and validated in a real test-bed within the FP7 CockpitCI project and H2020 ATENA project. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Industrial control system; Industrial internet of things (I2oTs); Industry 4.0; Logical filtering; Security","Bandpass filters; Computer circuits; Computer crime; Control systems; Controllers; Crime; Industry 4.0; Internet of things; Intrusion detection; Network security; Programmable logic controllers; Automation technology; Improving efficiency; Industrial control systems; Industrial internets; Industrial revolutions; Innovative approaches; Intrusion Detection Systems; Security; Intelligent control","http://www.schneider-electric.com/en/product-range/1468-modicon-m340/, Modicon M340 - Schneider Electric; The Bro Network Security Monitor, , https://www.bro.org/; Abdul Aziz, M.Z., Ibrahim, M.Y., Omar, A.M., Ab Rahman, R., Md Zan, M.M., Yusof, M.I., Performance analysis of application layer firewall (2012) 2012 IEEE Symposium on Wireless Technology and Applications (ISWTA), pp. 182-186. , http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6373838/, IEEE; Di Pietro, A., Foglietta, C., Palmieri, S., Panzieri, S., (2013) Assessing the impact of Cyber attacks on interdependent physical systems, pp. 215-227. , http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-642-45330-4_15, Springer, Berlin Heidelberg; Feng, Y., Foglietta, C., Baiocco, A., Panzieri, S., Wolthusen, S.D., (2013) Malicious false data injection in hierarchical electric power grid state estimation systems.

Especially, research and study for applying wireless network technology to safety-related and emergency preparedness systems in nuclear facilities are being conducted as well. However, wireless it is hard to apply physical access control on the wireless network using frequency. If digital systems of nuclear facility are compromised by cyber attack, public safety were not be guaranteed. From this point, the cyber security assessment must be performed when applying wireless network technologies to the systems in the nuclear facility. This study is to analyze and develop the cyber security assessment methodology with wireless network at nuclear facilities. We analyzed the cases of wireless network attacks broadly known in critical infrastructure and public facilities, and draw out the requirements and inspection activity in the cyber security assessment that must be checked in the wireless network. The requirements and activities presented in this paper are able to be the reference to establish the policy and guidelines for cyber security assessment when the nuclear facilities are applying the wireless network technology into the field. © 2018 IEEE.","Assessment; Critical infrastructure; Nuclear Facilities; Security; Wireless network","Access control; Computer crime; Critical infrastructures; Digital forensics; Electronic crime countermeasures; Industrial research; Nuclear energy; Public works; Sensor networks; Wireless networks; Assessment; Emergency preparedness; Industrial revolutions; Internet of Things (IOT); Nuclear facilities; Physical access controls; Security; Wireless network technologies; Network security","Lee S, Applicable approach of the wireless technology for Korean nuclear power plants (2013) Nuclear Engineering and Design, 265, pp. 519-525; (2009) Implementation Guideline for Wireless Networks and Wireless Equipment Condition Monitoring, , Electric Power Research Institute TR1019186; Kaldenbach, B.I., Assessment of wireless technologies and their application at nuclear facilities (2006) NUREG/CR-6882; https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/08/us/dallas-emergency-sirenshacking.html; Ruben, S., (2017) Go Nuclear Breaking Radiation Monitoring Devices, , IOActive; Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT, , SSA-901333: KRACK Attacks Vulnerabilities in Industrial; (2010) Cyber Security Programs for Nuclear Facilities, , GUIDE Regulatory 5.71.

The result is an ecosystem of heterogeneous physical and cyber components, such as programmable logic controllers, which are more and more exposed to cyber-physical attacks, i.e., security breaches in cyberspace that adversely affect the physical processes at the core of industrial control systems. We apply runtime enforcement techniques, based on an ad-hoc sub-class of Ligatti et al.'s edit automata, to enforce specification compliance in networks of potentially compromised controllers, formalised in Hennessy and Regan's Timed Process Language. We define a synthesis algorithm that, given an alphabet \mathcal{P} of observable actions and an enforceable regular expression e capturing a timed property for controllers, returns a monitor that enforces the property e during the execution of any (potentially corrupted) controller with alphabet \mathcal{P} and complying with the property e. Our monitors correct and suppress incorrect actions coming from corrupted controllers and emit actions in full autonomy when the controller under scrutiny is not able to do so in a correct manner. Besides classical properties, such as transparency and soundness, the proposed enforcement ensures non-obvious properties, such as polynomial complexity of the synthesis, deadlock-and diverge-freedom of monitored controllers, together with scalability when dealing with networks of controllers. © 2020 IEEE.","control system security; PLC malware; process calculus; Runtime enforcement","Control systems; Programmable logic controllers; Security of data; Security systems; Control system security; Industrial control systems; Industrial facilities; Polynomial complexity; Regular expressions; Runtime enforcements; Security breaches; Synthesis algorithms; Controllers","Huang, Y., Cárdenas, A.A., Amin, S., Lin, Z., Tsai, H., Sastry, S., Understanding the physical and economic consequences of attacks on control systems (2009) IJCIP, 2 (3), pp. 73-83; Kushner, D., The real story of stuxnet (2013) IEEE Spectrum, 50 (3), pp. 48-53; (2015) Cyber-Attack against Ukrainian Critical Infrastructure, , https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/alerts/IR-ALERT-H-16-056-01; Johnson, B., Caban, D., Krotofil, M., Scali, D., Brubaker, N., Glyer, C., Attackers deploy ics attack framework ""triton"" and cause operational disruption to critical infrastructure (2017) Threat Research Blog; Radvanovsky, B., Project shine: 1, 000, 000 internet-connected scada and ics stystems and counting (2013) Tofino Security; Malchow, J.-O., Klick, J., (2014) Sicherheit in Vernetzten Systemen: 21 2014 DFN-Workshop, pp. C2-C19. , Paulsen, C., ch.

Global competition in the world markets does not allow for increase of the volumes of production with purely conservative methods of cheapening of the manufactured product or service. In this situation, there’s a need for new solutions and approaches to the production process – i.e., transition to a new digital platform of interaction. In the conditions of informatization, only the companies that can transform their resources for new requirement of the forming economic model will remain in the market. This requires certain knowledge and understanding of the current changes – i.e., it is necessary to form a team of skilled specialists in the sphere of digitization, who possess the corresponding competencies. These specialists are to be trained by the corresponding educational establishments, which are a part of the infrastructure of the knowledge economy. According to the set goal, the following tasks are solved in this work: evaluation of the current tendencies of digitization of the social mode in view of transition to Industry 4.0; substantiation of the role of knowledge as the key resource in the model of the knowledge economy; proving that investments into creation and transfer of new knowledge will allow a country to increase competitive advantages and to ensure stable economic growth; evaluation of the volumes of state financing into the system of education and scientific research in Russia; determination of the main basic blocks of the knowledge economy; distinguishing specific features of the model of the knowledge economy in the conditions of transformation and transition to the philosophy of Industry 4.0. Methodology: The authors use the methods of normative and legal analysis and evaluation of the modern situation in the sphere of state management of the national economic system, content analysis, statistical analysis, formalization, and analogy. Results: In view of transition to the Fourth industrial revolution, traditional systems of interaction and organization of the process of production lose their former importance and competitiveness. In a new model of technological development, first roles belong to such information resource as knowledge, which is generated and passed by certain spheres of the national economy. In the structure of cost of manufactured goods and services, the cost of new knowledge accounts for a large share – as this resource takes the country’s production system to a new qualitative level of development. The authors substantiate the transition of the conservative model of economy to a new model of the knowledge economy and develop recommendations for correction and improvement of this transition. Conclusions: The authors systematize and substantiate the current processes of informatization – primarily, in the sphere of education and science. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Digitization; Education; Industry 4.0; Information resource; Knowledge economy; Science","Analog to digital conversion; Artificial intelligence; Education; Industry 4.0; International trade; Investments; Spheres; Analysis and evaluation; Educational establishments; Growth and development; Industrial revolutions; Information resource; Knowledge economy; Science; Technological development; Competition","Bogoviz, A.V., Lobova, S.V., Ragulina, Y.V., Luchitskaya, L.B., Shutova, T.V., Boosting innovative activity in companies: Problems and potential (2017) J.

Critical infrastructures, such as power plants and water treatment facilities, which heavily rely on ICS, have increasingly come under cyberattack in recent years. These cyberattacks pose severe threats to public safety as well as national security. Therefore, protecting ICS from cyberattack is an important research issue in the era of information technology and operation technology convergence. In this study, we propose an anomaly detection method based on semi-supervised techniques for industrial control systems, using the k-means and convolutional autoencoder methods. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the other methods in almost all performance metrics for gas pipeline and water storage tank datasets. © 2019 University of Split, FESB.","Anomaly detection; Convolutional autoencoder; Industrial control system; Intrusion detection system; K-means","Control systems; Convolution; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; National security; Water treatment; Anomaly detection methods; Auto encoders; Industrial control systems; Internet of things technologies; Intrusion Detection Systems; K-means; Technology and Operations; Water treatment facilities; Anomaly detection","Langner, R., Stuxnet: Dissecting a cyberwarfare weapon (2011) IEEE Security & Privacy, 9 (3), pp. 49-51; Falliere, N., Murchu, L.O., Chien, E., (2011) W32.

This development introduced a variety of new cyber threats, causing high financial damage, threatening lives and affecting the society. Known examples are Stuxnet, WannaCry and the attacks on the Ukrainian power grid. To prevent such attacks, it is indispensable to properly design, assess and maintain countermeasures and security strategies throughout the whole life cycle of the critical systems. For this, security has to be considered and assessed for every system design and redesign. However, common assessment tools and methodologies are not executed on a detailed system knowledge and therefore they are enhanced with penetration tests. Unfortunately, performing only abstract assessments is inadequate and penetration tests endanger the availability of the tested systems. Therefore, the latter cannot be performed on live systems executing critical processes. In this paper, we address these issues for Industrial Control Systems and explain how new concepts for continuous security-by-design or model-based system monitoring and automated vulnerability assessments can resolve them by exploiting new Industry 4.0 developments. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Automated vulnerability assessment; Critical infrastructure security; Defense-in-depth; ICS security; Knowledge base; Security life cycle management; Security-by-design","Availability; Computer control systems; Electric power transmission networks; Intelligent control; Knowledge based systems; Life cycle; Public works; Systems analysis; Critical infrastructure securities; Defense in depth; Knowledge base; Life-cycle management; Security by designs; Vulnerability assessments; Critical infrastructures","Plcopen and OPC Foundation: OPC UA Information Model for IEC 61131–3., , Standard, OPC Foundation, March 2010; Bjorklund, M., YANG-A Data Modeling Language for the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF), , https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6020.txt, RFC 6020, RFC Editor, October 2010; Cyber Security Assessments of Industrial Control Systems: A Good Practice Guide, , April 2011; Dürkop, L., Imtiaz, J., Trsek, H., Wisniewski, L., Jasperneite, J., Using OPC-UA for the auto configuration of real-time ethernet systems (2013) 2013 11Th IEEE International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN), pp. 248-253. , https://doi.org/10.1109/INDIN.2013.6622890, July; Enns, R., Bjorklund, M., Schoenwaelder, J., Bierman, A., (2011) Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF), , https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6241, RFC 6241, RFC Editor, June; Holm, H., Sommestadt, T., Ekstedt, M., Nordström, L., Cysemol: Atool for cyber security analysis of enterprises (2013) 22Nd International Conference and Exhibition on Electricity Distribution (CIRED 2013), p. 1109. , https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2013.1077, IEEE, Piscataway; (2016) Overview and Concepts.

To enhance CPS security, it is necessary to realistically reproduce and test scenarios that reflect the characteristics of the target system. Prior to developing technologies for CPS security, individual experimental environments are necessary to evaluate the developed technologies. In this paper, we propose a Controller-in-the-Middle (CitM) scheme that provides a flexible experimental environment for CPS security, which consists of an independent process exchanged between field devices and a complex process combining different independent processes. Using the proposed scheme, various scenarios and test environment can be reproduced flexibly. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Cyber-Physical System; Dataset; Security; Testbed","Cyber Physical System; Testbeds; Complex Processes; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Dataset; Experimental environment; Security; Security threats; Target systems; Test Environment; Embedded systems","Goh, J., Adepu, S., Junejo, K.N., Mathur, A., A dataset to support research in the design of secure water treatment systems (2016) The 11th International Conference on Critical Information Infrastructures Security; Henzinger, T.A., The theory of hybrid automata (2000) Verification of Digital and Hybrid Systems, pp. 265-292. , Springer; Lemay, A., Fernandez, J.M., Providing SCADA network data sets for intrusion detection research (2016) 9th Workshop on Cyber Security Experimentation and Test (CSET 16), , USENIX Association; Morris, T., Gao, W., Industrial control system traffic data sets for intrusion detection research (2014) Critical Infrastructure Protection VIII, pp. 65-78. , Jonathan Butts and Sujeet Shenoi (Eds.).

It illustrates the use of multi-agent systems in manufacturing and leverages new Industry 4.0 design principles to cope with manufacturing requirements in factories of the future: rapidly changing customer needs, market volatility and shortened product life cycles. Three main contributions are identified: (i) distributed auction-based coordination allows local decision making and task allocation, (ii) distributed model predictive control-based transportation enables free space collision avoidance of automated guided vehicles (AGVs), and (iii) distributed vision-based localisation provides scalable and dynamic position information of key resources on the factory floor. © 2018 International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (www.ifaamas.org).

Emails or messages which are not delivered in a proper time-frame could lead to omit a meeting or a discussion with colleagues. Interconnected CPS in different domains, like autonomous driving, smart grids, Industry 4.0, needs a guaranteed and safe delivery of information. Nowadays distributed application in critical infrastructures such as transportation (e.g. air traffic management, train control, traffic management), financial services, or electricity systems, are often implemented in dedicated network infrastructures not using the public Internet. This leads to high expenditures (CAPEX and OPEX) for the companies to maintain these separated and dedicated telecommunication infrastructure. Our approach in this work is to verify concepts to share the Internet, as a telecommunication infrastructure for critical and non-critical applications. This reduces the effort to implement and to manage different communication architectures. The present work develops and evaluates methods and procedures that enable high reliable communication between two endpoints over several shared telecommunication networks for future critical and uncritical applications. Our approach shows that it is possible to use the public Internet for future communication requirements in a converged network. Further innovations include the integration of novel network technologies, such as software-defined networks (SDN), programming protocol independent packet processors (P4), and self-adaptive and autonomous network management functions. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Critical infrastructure; High reliable communication; Network function visualisation; NFV orchestration; P4; Self adaptive network management; Software defined networking","Air traffic control; Computer privacy; Computer software; Critical infrastructures; Data privacy; Embedded systems; Network function virtualization; Network management; Public works; Safety engineering; Software defined networking; Software reliability; Systems engineering; Air Traffic Management; Communication architectures; Distributed applications; High reliable; Network functions; NFV orchestration; Reliable communication; Telecommunication infrastructures; Network architecture","http://sflow.com/, sFlow.com; (2014) Mqtt Version 3.1.1, , http://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v3.1.1/os/mqtt-v3.1.1-os.pdf, October; (2015) Open Flow Based System for Multi Energy Domain, , https://www.salzburgresearch.at/en/projekt/opossum-2/, June, Accessed 24 Jan; Avizienis, A., Laprie, J.C., Randell, B., Landwehr, C., Basic concepts and taxonomy of dependable and secure computing (2004) IEEE Trans.

This cybernetic–mechatronic augmentation expanded the attack vectors in critical infrastructure's network, which gained the attraction of both cyber-offenders and cybersecurity researchers. Though the recent research works focus on developing proficient cybersecurity mechanisms, they often fail to address the major challenges such as handling the unseen zero-day exploits and detecting data irregularities that result in a poor attack detection rate. Hence to address the aforementioned challenges, this research article proposes an intelligent multi-level intrusion detection system to detect data-abnormalities in process-control network packets. The proposed approach involves the following phases: (i) Bloom-filter based payload level detection, (ii) partition-based Kohonen mapping for learning abnormal data patterns using a deep version of Kohonen neural network enhanced by principal component analysis and partitioning property of Hypergraph, and (iii) BLOSOM – a hybrid anomaly detection model. The impact of the proposed approach has been validated with the high-dimensional and heterogeneous benchmark datasets obtained from Mississippi State University (Gas-pipeline dataset) and Singapore University of Technology and Design (Secure WAter Treatment dataset). The proposed approach outscores the existing State-of-the-art approaches in terms of Precision, Recall, F-Score & Classification Accuracy and found to be robust, scalable & computationally attractive. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Communication system security; Industrial control; Intrusion detection; Kohonen feature maps; Process control; SCADA systems","Intrusion detection; Water treatment; Anomaly detection models; Classification accuracy; Integrating information; Intrusion Detection Systems; Kohonen neural networks; Mississippi State University; State-of-the-art approach; Technology and designs; Anomaly detection","Stouffer, K., Falco, J., Scarfone, K., GUIDE to industrial control systems (ICS) security (2011) Stuxnet Comput.

This report reviews issues related to machine modelling and simulations concerning further development of mechanical devices and their control systems as part of novel projects under the Industry 4.0 paradigm. The challenges faced by the industry have generated novel technologies used in the construction of dynamic, intelligent, flexible and open applications, capable of working in real time environments. Thus, in an Industry 4.0 environment, the data generated by sensor networks requires AI/CI to apply close-to-real-time data analysis techniques. In this way industry can face both fresh opportunities and challenges, including predictive analysis using computer tools capable of detecting patterns in the data based on the same rules that can be used to formulate the prediction. © 2021 The Author(s).","Artificial intelligence; Industry 4.0; Internet of Things; Models; Simulation","Industry 4.0; Predictive analytics; Sensor networks; Computer tools; Machine modelling; Mechanical device; Practical issues; Real time data analysis; Real-time environment; Way industries; Artificial intelligence","(2019) Artificial intelligence quotient, , 2nd edition, Digital Poland Microsoft Foundation; (2019) IoT in the Polish economy, Report of the working group for the Internet of Things at the Ministry of Digital Affairs, , Ministry of Digital Affairs; (2019), Towards the Industry 4.0, HBR Polska, ICAN, How to do IT, ASTOR; (2019) The new industrial revolution, How Europe will succeed, , Industry 4.0, Company Report Roland Berger; Tay, S., Te Chuan, L., Aziati, A., Nur Aizat, A., An Overview of Industry 4.0: Definition, Components, and Government Initiatives (2018) J.

With IR 4.0, new technologies will emerge into new ways of handling complex tasks in robust techniques utilizing smart manufacturing technologies and digitized supply networks in business-driven operations. This leads to new cybersecurity risks that might cause infrequent business disruptions due to the increasing of sophisticated cyberthreats targeting the business- critical infrastructure. Cybersecurity policies, with associated standards, procedures and guidelines, are the fundamental to handle and manage the digital intrusions. Cybersecurity is a crucial element in any business to secure data and ultimately securing the human safety. The current cybersecurity policies must cover areas of IR 4.0 environment to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA) of the business data and assets. This paper analytically explores how to prevent inheriting digitalization weaknesses of IR 3.0 seeping into IR 4.0. The paper highlights the security strategy that could help in making IR 4.0 experience more effective, efficient and secure. In addition, the paper illustrates some of IR 4.0 inherited cybersecurity risk factors and associated scenarios, identifies key challenges, benefits, and security concerns for IR 4.0 environment. Moreover, the paper proposes the major elements must be considered for IR 4.0 cybersecurity policy.

MEBN has sufficient expressive power for general-purpose knowledge representation and reasoning, and is the logical basis of Probabilistic Web Ontology Language (PR-OWL), a representation language for probabilistic ontologies. Developing an MEBN model to support a given application is a challenge, requiring definition of entities, relationships, random variables, conditional dependence relationships, and probability distributions. When available, data can be invaluable both to improve performance and to streamline development. By far the most common format for available data is the relational database (RDB). Relational databases describe and organize data according to the Relational Model (RM). Developing an MEBN model from data stored in an RDB therefore requires mapping between the two formalisms. This paper presents MEBN-RM, a set of mapping rules between key elements of MEBN and RM. We identify links between the two languages (RM and MEBN) and define four levels of mapping from elements of RM to elements of MEBN. These definitions are implemented in the MEBN-RM algorithm, which converts a relational schema in RM to a partial MEBN model. Through this research, the software has been released as an MEBN-RM open-source software tool. The method is illustrated through two example use cases using MEBN-RM to develop MEBN models: a Critical Infrastructure Defense System and a Smart Manufacturing System. Both systems are proof-of-concept systems used for situation awareness, where data coming from various sensors are stored in RDBs and converted into MEBN models through the MEBN-RM algorithm. In these use cases, we evaluate the performance of the MEBN-RM algorithm in terms of mapping speed and quality to show its efficiency in MEBN modeling. © 2019 by the authors.","Mapping model; MEBN machine learning; MEBN modeling; Multi-Entity Bayesian Networks; Probabilistic graphical model; Probabilistic Web Ontology Language; Relational Model; Semantic web; Statistical Relational Learning",,"Koller, D., Friedman, N., Džeroski, S., Sutton, C., McCallum, A., Pfeffer, A., Abbeel, P., Meek, C., (2007) Introduction to Statistical Relational Learning, , MIT Press: Cambridge, MA, USA; MüUller, W., Kuwertz, A., Mühlenberg, D., Sander, J., Semantic information fusion to enhance situational awareness in surveillance scenarios (2017) Proceedings of the 2017 IEEE International Conference on Multisensor Fusion and Integration for Intelligent Systems (MFI), pp. 397-402. , Daegu, Korea, 16-18 November; Morariu, V.I., Davis, L.S., Multi-agent event recognition in structured scenarios (2011) Proceedings of the CVPR 2011, pp. 3289-3296. , Colorado Springs, CO, USA, 20-25 June; Wu, C., Aghajan, H., User-centric environment discovery with camera networks in smart homes (2011) IEEE Trans.

Due to the advent of Industry 4.0 and the rising need for platform transparency and uniformity, developers opt for open-source modular system software that replace the conventional monolithic firmware approach. A common part of the modern embedded system is the Device Tree, a hardware description structure leveraged by the OS kernel. This modular approach and its malleability, however, can be exposed as a vulnerability and enable an array of attacks that would disrupt and destabilize the system. In this paper, we consider the Device Tree from a cybersecurity perspective. We identify scenarios that would enable covert attacks on a target system as well as propose countermeasures from the state-of-the-art. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Embedded systems; Firmware; Forestry; Open source software; Cyber security; Hardware descriptions; Modern embedded systems; Modular approach; Modular system software; Open platforms; Personal devices; State of the art; Open systems","Lee, J., Bagheri, B., Kao, H.-A., A cyber-physical systems architecture for industry 4. 0-based manufacturing systems (2015) Manufacturing Letters, 3, pp. 18-23; Denk, W., (2011) The Denx U-boot and Linux Guide (Dulg) for Canyonlands, , https://www.denx.de/wiki/DULG/Manual, [June 15, 2018]; (2017) The Devicetree Specification, , https://www.devicetree.org/, Linaro, [June 15, 2018]; McLaughlin, S., Konstantinou, C., Wang, X., Davi, L., Sadeghi, A.-R., Maniatakos, M., Karri, R., The cybersecurity landscape in industrial control systems (2016) Proceedings of the IEEE, 104 (5), pp. 1039-1057; Langner, R., Stuxnet: Dissecting a cyberwarfare weapon (2011) IEEE Security & Privacy, 9 (3), pp. 49-51; Case, D.U., Analysis of the cyber attack on the ukrainian power grid (2016) Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center (E-ISAC); David Gibson, J.L., (2018) The Device Tree Compiler (Dtc) Toolchain, , https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/dtc/dtc.git/about/, [June 18, 2018]; Keliris, A., Maniatakos, M., Remote field device fingerprinting using device-specific modbus information (2016) Circuits and Systems (MWSCAS), 2016 IEEE 59th International Midwest Symposium On.

OPC UA defines several models for these services and has already been deployed by industrial partners in their efforts to achieve I4.0 market readiness and to provide more robust systems. Of particular interest is the security services offered by OPC UA, as they are expected to strengthen the security posture of industrial automation systems, which have so far suffered a number of sophisticated cyber-attacks. In general, cyber-attacks are more severe based on the level of access acquired by the attacker, for example, an attacker with unrestricted administrative level access can issue more powerful commands. It is safe to say then that a more stringent access control security concept can offer systems greater protection from unauthorized access. Several access control models exist, which are categorized under two headings discretionary (data owners/users set the access control rules) and non-discretionary (security administrators control the access granted to users). Here, a non-discretionary access control model, namely the attribute-based access control (ABAC) model is compared to the role-based access control (also non-discretionary) typically assumed with OPC UA, to ascertain how a more granular security structure with ABAC could provide additional security advantages for industry. © 2019 Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI).

The magnitude of the next industrial revolution is a huge reality but it also needs to be seen for what it really is in terms of its progress, sub-revolutions, social dangers and unique cyber-physical systems (algorithms). The smart telematics, machine-to-machine (M2M) technology and connected devices through computer-based systems are not all new or disruptive. The notion that disruption is by default an inherent FIR value may be questioned especially when personal transformation is demanded or thriving in a time of endless innovation. An agile business in the digital age is not the only option for innovation improvement or for commendable transformation journeys. The FIR identity therefore needs to be clarified by means of an accepted model. An qualitative exploratory research approach was used to look deeper into the FIR movement and to address the research problem by providing perspectives about the hype, identifying Triple-Helix (TH) as a significant sub-revolution of the FIR and to make suggestions for further research to clarify its identity. © 2019, IEOM Society International.","Entrepreneurial university; Fouth industrial revolution (FIR); Innovation eco-systems; Social and customer intelligence (CI); Triple-helix (TH)",,"Adams, D.Q., Mpofu, K.M., What has Industry 4.0 got to do with us?

Unfortunately, these do not come without a price; in this case the price to pay is the increased vulnerabilities, the increased threats and the increased attack surface that result when industrial systems originally designed with little or no cybersecurity in mind connect to the Internet. Consequently, the cybersecurity of the IIoT becomes of paramount importance. Research has started focusing on this area, as well as on the related areas of cyber-physical systems security and industrial network security, but a multitude of issues still remain to be addressed. In this chapter, we review recent research results in the area of IIoT security, with an eye towards identifying trends on one hand and areas where research seems to lag behind on the other, by classifying research results using the security lifecycle model of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) framework for improving the cybersecurity of critical infrastructures. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Industrial IoT; Industry 4.0; IoT; NIST framework; Security",,"Alcaraz, C., Resilient industrial control systems based on multiple redundancy (2017) Int J Crit Infrastruct (IJCIS), 13 (2-3), pp. 278-2951; Alcaraz, C., Cloud-assisted dynamic resilience for cyber-physical control systems (2018) IEEE Wirel Commun, 25 (1), pp. 76-82; Alcaraz, C., Lopez, J., Secure interoperability in cyber-physical systems (2017) Security Solutions and Applied Cryptography in Smart Grid Communications, pp. 137-158. , Ferrag MA, Ahmim A, IGI Global, Hershey, pp; Alcaraz, C., Lopez, J., A cyber-physical systems-based checkpoint model for structural controllability (2018) IEEE Syst J, 12, pp. 1-12; Alcaraz, C., Roman, R., Najera, P., Lopez, J., Security of industrial sensor network-based remote substations in the context of the Internet of Things (2013) Ad Hoc Netw, 11 (3), pp. 1091-1104; Bakhshi, Z., Balador, A., Mustafa, J., Industrial IoT security threats and concerns by considering Cisco and Microsoft IoT reference models (2018) 2018 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference Workshops (WCNCW), Apr 2018.

Communication and connectivity of an operational data collection are required principal. OPC Unified Architecture and standards like ISA95 are key resources to develop automated interfaces between equipment and manufacturing execution system (MES). The target is to integrate complex equipment in a convenient way through the use of a companion specification, a dynamic address space and a OPC UA client characterisation process. Challenges are the reconciliation of the right programming languages, the integration of generic, domain agnostic, domain specific and equipment specific information models. This study describes the generic approach and demonstrates its applicability in a complex manufacturing environment, serving as a blueprint for other environments. The outlined concept is based on C#/LabView source-code developed for semiconductor back-end equipment, which interacts with an MES. The proposed system is validated for a finaltesting- unit in the production of kW-class high-power laser diodes. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Companion specification; Information model; ISA95; Machine connectivity; Manufacturing execution system; MES; OPC UA; Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture; Smart factory","High power lasers; Information theory; Process control; Specifications; Information Modeling; ISA95; Manufacturing Execution System; OPC UA; Unified architecture; Computer architecture","Cemernek, D., Gursch, H., Kern, R., Big data as a promoter of industry 4.0: Lessons of the semiconductor industry (2017) 2017 IEEE 15th International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN), , Emden; Chen, B., Smart factory of industry 4.0: Key technologies, application case, and challenges (2018) IEEE Access, 6, pp. 6505-6519; Deuse, J., Weisner, K., Hengstebeck, A., Busch, F., Gestaltung von Produktionssystemen im Kontext von Industrie 4.0 (2015) Zukunft der Arbeit in Industrie 4.0, pp. 99-109. , Springer, Berlin; Gittler, T., Gontarz, A., Weiss, L., Wegener, K., A fundamental approach for data acquisition on machine tools as enabler for analytical Industrie 4.0 applications (2018) 12th CIRP Conference on Intelligent Computation in Manufacturing Engineering, , Ischia; Guo, N., Liu, Y.-H., Yan, M.-H., Chip manufacturing, data integration and transmission (2017) Current Trends in Computer Science and Mechanical Automation, 2, pp. 41-51; Hankel, M., (2015) Industrie 4.0: Das Referenzarchitekturmodell Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0), , ZVEI, Frankfurt am Mein; Harju, J., (2015) Plant Information Models for OPC UA: Case Copper Refinery, , Tampere University of Technology, Nurmijärvi; Kagermann, H., Chancen von Industrie 4.0 nutzen (2014) Industrie 4.0 in Produktion, Automatisierung und Logistik, , Springer, Wiesbaden; Kagermann, H., Wahlster, W., Helbig, J., (2013) Umsetzungsempfehlungen Für das Zukunftsprojekt Industrie 4.0: Abschlussbericht des Arbeitskreises Industrie 4.0, , acatech, Frankfurt am Main; Kletti, J., (2015) MES - Manufacturing Execution System, , Springer Verlag, Heidelberg; Kolberg, D., Zühlke, D., Lean automation enabled by Industry 4.0 technologies (2015) IFAC-PapersOnLine, 28 (3), pp. 1870-1875; Kolberg, D., Knobloch, J., Zühlke, D., Towards a lean automation interface for workstations (2017) International Journal of Production Research, 55 (10), pp. 2845-2856; Monostori, L., Manufacturing technology cyber-physical systems in manufacturing (2016) CIRP Annals - Manufacturing Technology, 65 (2), pp. 621-641; Ono, T., Ali, S., Hunkar, P., Brandl, D., (2013) OPC Unified Architecture for ISA-95 Common Object Model, , OPC Foundation, Scottsdale (AZ); (2017) OPC Unified Architecture Part 1: Overview and Concepts, , OPC Foundation, OPC Foundation, Scottsdale (AZ); Palonen, O., (2010) Object-Oriented Implementation of OPC UA Information Models in Java, , Aalto University School of Science and Technology, Espoo; Pauker, F., Frühwirth, T., Kittl, B., Kastner, W., A systematic approach to OPC UA information model design (2016) Proceedings of the 49th CIRP Conference on Manufacturing Systems, , Stuttgart; Pethig, F., (2017) Industrie 4.0 Communication Guideline Based on OPC UA, , VDMA Verlag GmbH, Frankfurt am Main; (2017) OPC UA Java SDK Code Generator Manual, , Prosys OPC Ltd, Prosys OPC Ltd, Espoo; Radziwon, A., Bilberg, A., Bogers, M., Madsen, E.S., The smart factory: Exploring adaptive and flexible manufacturing solutions (2014) Procedia Engineering, 69 (69), pp. 1184-1190; Shariatzadeh, N., Lundholm, T., Lindberg, L., Sivard, G., Integration of digital factory with smart factory based on internet of things (2016) 26th CIRP Design Conference, , Stockholm; (2019) Camstar Semiconductor Suite, , https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/global/en/products/manufacturingoperations-center/camstar-semiconductor-suite.html, Siemens Product Lifecycle Management Software Inc.

This safety system is important as it acts as a security measure against fire accident which could lead to death and destruction of properties. This paper propose an advanced gas leakage, fire and power supply failure monitoring system with Arduino UNO and GSM Module as its embedded system. Among the features of this system are their ability to detect the presence of smoke, gases and power failure at homes and factories, then the system will send a text message using Short Message Service (SMS) to the registered mobile number via GSM Module informing the user the situation and location of the incident. As a result, the user or person in charge can respond to the emergency situation accordingly and alert the fire departments or relevant authorities in time. This system could help the user to transform the way they protect their property and critical infrastructure. Successful safety and security transformation requires a combination of end user structural and operational changes as well as technology evolution enablement. This is in line with the Fourth Industrial Revolution (known as IR4.0), that propose substantial increase in the deployment of sensors for collecting, processing, and communicating measurement data in real time in order to diverse working environments, thus, resulting in advancement and convergence of technologies.

Optimization of operation condition was conducted by using RSM-CI method as an efficient cheminformatics approach to presented the optimum conditions as mathematical models which capable in predicting the resulted sugar and ethanol from the process for a define NaOH Concentration in pretreatment, substrate loading and cellulase loading. The observed operation conditions were the interactive effect of NaOH concentration (1-3 M) in the alkaline pretreatment, cellulase loading (15 - 25 FPU/gr substrate-dw) and substrate loading (15 - 35% dw). The resulted reducing sugar and ethanol concentration were the explanatory variables. The models coefficient of determination (R2) for resulted sugar and ethanol concentration were 0.718 and 0.972, respectively, which gave confidence prediction in the range of substrate loading 20 - 35%w, cellulase loading in range 15-25 FPU/gr-substrate and pulp that treated with caustic soda in concentration range 1.5 - 3 M. The validated optimum condition was obtained when substrate loading was 28%w, cellulase loading was 15 FPU/gr-substrate and pulp was treated with caustic soda 1.5M. At this operation condition the resulted ethanol concentration was 7.25±0.22%V which was equal to ethanol yield 20.7g-ethanol/g-substrate.

The advent of cloud computing facilities and recently of edge computing environments has increased the aforementioned paradigm shift towards service provisioning. In this context, various “traditional” critical infrastructure components have turned to services, being deployed and managed on top of cloud and edge computing infrastructures. However, the latter poses a specific challenge: the services of the critical infrastructures within and across application verticals/domains (e.g., transportation, health, industrial venues, etc.) need to be continuously available with near-zero downtime. In this context, this paper presents an approach for high-performance monitoring and failure detection of critical infrastructure services that are deployed in virtualized environments. The failure detection framework consists of distributed agents (i.e., monitoring services) to ensure timely collection of monitoring data, while it is enhanced with a voting algorithm to minimize the case of false positives. The goal of the proposed approach is to detect failures in datacenters that support critical infrastructures by targeting both the acquisition of monitoring data in a performant way and the minimization of false positives in terms of potential failure detection. The specific approach is the baseline towards decision making and triggering of actions in runtime to ensure service high availability, given that it provides the required data for decision making on time with high accuracy. © 2018 by the author.

Utility companies have to maintain and operate an infrastructure, which shall guarantee security of supplies to people, companies and organizations in their territory. Such infrastructure may comprise networks for electricity, gas, heat, water, fibre-optic communication and facilities for energy production, lighting, waste or waste water treatment. Like in all other sectors digitalization will penetrate every technical systems of said infrastructure driven by the demand for transparency and the need for more flexibility to grant reliable operation. The ongoing transition from a centralized production of electrical energy in large-scale power plants towards a highly increasing decentralized, strongly fluctuating feed-in of electricity from renewable energy sources requires automatic control of the various processes. Monitoring to detect and to react on events and defaults in the system will become mandatory. Measurement and automated process control mechanisms will be implemented to balance loads within seconds. Some ICT solutions have already found their way into the electrical grid such as On-Load-Tap-Changers (OLTC), smart meters or remote cut-off switching of micro power plants. In contrast to the benefits a higher number of ICT installations might provide hackers new opportunities to get unauthorized access. Monitoring or metering data (though read-only) might get misused or manipulated while active settings and switching of critical or safety relevant functions would lead to severe damage to utilities and their clients. This paper describes the requirements to systems and components of utilities’ infrastructure which have to be upgraded in order to foster automation on the one hand and to fit the needs for security of supplies on the other. SWW is a municipal, highly innovative utility company and Distribution System Operator (DSO) that ensures supply of the metropolitan area of Wunsiedel and seven other municipalities serving also as a field test laboratory to demonstrate and qualify new technologies in said domain. For years, SWW and its subordinated service companies have been focusing on the consistent production, use and expansion of renewable energy and sustainable technologies. The main midterm energy goal of the city Wunsiedel and SWW is energy self-sufficiency by following the cellular approach according to VDE study (Speh et al.: VDE Study “The Cellular Approach”, VDE/ETG, Frankfurt, June 16, 2015). Digitalization and automation play a major role in this concept. The authors provide technical requirements to upgrade utilities infrastructure and propose changes to regulations which block the investment into relevant technologies or security measures. At the moment the basic developments described here are driven and sponsored by strategic research programs of the EU or national R&D funds. © 2017, Springer Verlag Wien.","cellular approach; critical infrastructure; cyber security; cyber-attack; digitalization; distributed energy systems; DSO; EEG; energy management; energy regulations; energy supply; field test; Industry 4.0; IoT; load balancing; Smart Grid; smart home; smart metering; utility services","Automation; Critical infrastructures; Electric power transmission networks; Electroencephalography; Energy management; Energy policy; Intelligent buildings; Investments; Personal computing; Process control; Public works; Renewable energy resources; Resource allocation; Voltage control; Waste treatment; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment; cellular approach; Cyber security; Cyber-attacks; digitalization; Distributed energy systems; Energy regulation; Energy supplies; Field test; Smart grid; Smart homes; Smart metering; utility services; Smart power grids","Speh, R., Schegner, P., (2015) VDE study “The cellular approach, , Frankfurt, VDE/ETG (Association for Electrical, Electronic & Information Technologies): June 16, 2015; Kleineidam, G., Krasser, M., Reischböck, M., The cellular approach – smart energy region wunsiedel, testbed for smart grid, smart metering and smart home solutions (2016) Electr.

Firms are increasingly competing to secure key resources, such as patents. Patent-based competition, e.g., patent litigation, is increasingly fierce and has been largely used as a strategic weapon against rivals. It is crucial to explore the conditions under which firms can improve their performance when taking action to address patent-based competition. We suggest that the effectiveness of different types of actions is contingent on technological diversification, open innovation, and network position. Using data from the U.S. communications equipment industry on patent infringement lawsuits, we find that firms pursuing attacks perform better. These positive effects are amplified when firms have a more diversified technological portfolio, whereas the adoption of outbound open innovation weakens the positive effects. Furthermore, although defenders are adversely affected when they are attacked, these negative effects are mitigated when firms can utilize inbound open innovation or operate in a less crowded environment. Our study contributes by extending the competitive dynamics literature to the context of patent-based competition. © 2021","Network position; Open innovation; Patent-based competition; Technological diversification","Competition; Data communication equipment; Decision making; Industry 4.0; Laws and legislation; Communications equipment; Competitive dynamics; Industrial revolutions; Patent infringements; Patent litigation; Strategic decision making; Strategic weapons; Technological diversification; Patents and inventions; competition (economics); decision making; industrial performance; industrial technology; innovation; technology adoption; United States","Agarwal, R., Helfat, C.E., Strategic renewal of organizations (2009) Organ.

However, IEEE 802.11 networks may not always provide the seamless connectivity and minimal throughput required for Industry 4.0 communications because of their susceptibility to interference from other devices operating in the unlicensed “Industrial, Scientific, and Medical” frequency band. Here we analyzed how a wireless audio transmitter operating on this band influences the throughput of an IEEE 802.11 b/g/n network under laboratory conditions. Wireless audio transmission reduced mean throughput by 85%, rendering the IEEE 802.11 b/g/n network nearly unusable. Our analysis suggests that in order for IEEE 802.11 wireless networks to support Industrial 4.0 applications, attention should be paid to the physical layer as well as the data or upper layers, and critical services should not transmit on the 2.4 GHz band. These findings may contribute to understanding and managing IEEE 802.11 wireless networks in various Industry 4.0 contexts. © 2021 by the authors.

In today's era, artificial intelligence plays a crucial role in defining the period of Industry 4.0. In this research study, we have presented Computational Intelligence based Machine Condition Monitoring system architecture for determination of developing faults in industrial machines. The goal is to increase efficiency of machines and reduce the cost. The architecture is fusion of machine sensitive sensors, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and databases, to develop an autonomous fault diagnostic system. To explain CI-MCMs, we have used neural networks on sensor data obtained from hydraulic system. The results obtained by neural network were compared with those obtained from traditional methods. © 2021 IEEE.","Computational Intelligence; Hydraulic System; Industry 4.0; Machine Condition Monitoring","Computer architecture; Hydraulic equipment; Industrial research; Intelligent computing; Network architecture; Neural networks; Fault diagnostic systems; Hydraulic system; Industrial machines; Machine condition monitoring; Research studies; Sensitive sensors; Sensor data; Condition monitoring","Xu, Li Da, Xu, Eric L., Li, Ling, Industry 4.0: State of the art and future trends (2018) International Journal of Production Research, 56 (8), pp. 2941-2962; Gittler, Thomas, Stoop, Fabian, Kryscio, David, Weiss, Lukas, Wegener, Konrad, Condition monitoring system for machine tool auxiliaries (2020) Procedia CIRP, 88, pp. 358-363; Tandon, N., Parey, A., Condition Monitoring of Rotary Machines (2006) Condition Monitoring and Control for Intelligent Manufacturing, , Wang L., Gao R.X.

Such systems are essential for the functioning of the society and economy. On one hand, they have flexible infrastructure of heterogeneous systems and assets. On the other hand, they are social systems, which include collaborating humans and artificial decision makers. Such (human plus machine) resources must be pre-trained to perform their mission with high efficiency. Both human and machine learning approaches must be bridged to enable such training. The importance of these systems requires the anticipation of the potential and previously unknown worst-case scenarios during training. In this paper, we provide an adversarial training framework for the collective intelligence. We show how cognitive capabilities can be copied (“cloned”) from humans and trained as a (responsible) collective intelligence. We made some modifications to the Generative Adversarial Networks architectures and adapted them for the cloning and training tasks. We modified the Discriminator component to a so-called “Turing Discriminator”, which includes one or several human and artificial discriminators working together. We also discussed the concept of cellular intelligence, where a person can act and collaborate in a group together with their own cognitive clones. © 2021 The Authors.

Aim: The purpose of this review is to explore the prevalence of convergence insufficiency (CI) in younger populations and to map any associations between CI, near work and e-device usage. Method: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using Elsevier, PubMed, Medline and Ebscohost databases. The literature search used the following keywords in various combinations: ‘Convergence Insufficiency’, ‘Binocular vision status of primary school children’, ‘E-learning’, ‘M-learning’, ‘Computer vision syndrome’, ‘Digital eye syndrome’, ‘E-devices and children’. Results: The observed prevalence of CI ranges from 5.46% to 13.00% among non-clinical studies and from 3.50% to 18.00% among clinical studies. The prevalence among primary school children ranges from 6.80% to 31.40% whilst CI among high school children may be as prevalent as 32.60%, depending on the diagnostic criteria employed. There is mixed evidence showing the association between screen time and myopia. No studies were identified showing a direct association between CI and e-device use. Conclusion: Convergence insufficiency has proven to be a prevalent condition among both young children and young adult populations. There is a need for studies to investigate the prevalence of CI in younger populations who learn in a digital environment. This may highlight exposure to the modifiable factor of screen time in managing the condition in the context of a tech-infused lifestyle. © 2021. The Author(s). Licensee: AOSIS.

Although these CPISs focus on the security of air-gapped network environments, strict isolation from the outside network is difficult to achieve, leading to various attacks. CPISs also comprise various devices and proprietary communication protocols that are used exclusively for each domain and site. Therefore, experts have to adopt a customized strategy to enhance security in CPIS networks after analyzing each domain, device, and protocol in advance. These methods require a significant amount of time, cost, and manpower; consequently, they are difficult to apply existing security methods in the real field. As a solution, a method is proposed herein that includes the following: 1) inferencing the CPIS protocol format and field semantics based on the characteristics of CPIS networks and protocols; 2) multilevel anomaly detection based on the meaning and values of each inferred field. The proposed method does not require knowledge of each site and protocol. In addition, the inference method can be used to analyze the payload field, including the state and measurement value, as well as the header field. Finally, we validate the proposed technique using an open-source CPIS network dataset including response injection, command injection, denial-of-service, and reconnaissance attacks. In addition, in the aspect of detection efficiency, the proposed technique exhibits comparable performance to that of existing knowledge-based anomaly detection methods. © 2013 IEEE.","cyber security; Cyber-physical infrastructure systems; Ethernet-based industrial protocol; industrial control systems; unknown payload anomaly detection","Anomaly detection; Cyber Physical System; Denial-of-service attack; Internet protocols; Knowledge based systems; Semantics; Water treatment; Anomaly detection methods; Command injections; Detection efficiency; Distribution facilities; Infrastructure systems; Network environments; Smart manufacturing; Water treatment facilities; Network security","Sauter, T., The three generations of field-level networks-Evolution and compatibility issues (2010) IEEE Trans.

This trend, nowadays widely known by the term “Industry 4.0”, leads to a new kind of automated production. However, the rising number of dynamically interconnected elements in industrial production lines results in such a system being transformed into a complex System of Systems (SoS). Due to the increasing complexity and the challenges accompanied by this change, conventional engineering methods using generic principles reach their limits when developing this type of systems. With varying approaches only trying to find a solution for small-scaled areas of this problem statement, the need for a holistic methodology becomes more and more obvious. Having recognized this issue, one of the most promising approaches has been introduced with the Reference Architecture Model Industry 4.0 (RAMI 4.0). However, in the current point of view, this domain-specific architecture framework is missing specifications to address all aspects of such a critical infrastructure. Thus, this paper introduces a comprehensive modeling approach utilizing methods applied in Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and including domain-specific particularities as well as architectural concepts with the goal to enable mutual engineering of current and future industrial systems. The resulting artifacts, a domain-specific language (DSL), an architecture definition and a development process, are thereby consolidated in a ready to use software framework, whose applicability was evaluated by a real-world case study. © 2021 by the authors.

These industrial devices will be even more connected, due to the trend of Industry 4.0 and Internet of Things (IoT), to provide additional functionality. An example for a use case is predictive maintenance, where sensor data is required, to e.g. replace defective parts before outage. While connectivity enables easier and more efficient process management, it also increases the attack surface for cyber-attacks. To provide secure operation for interconnected ICSs additional protection measures, like asset management should be applied, to observe and maintain assets within a control network. One of the first steps to improve cyber-security with asset management is device identification in ICS networks. A common method for device identification is active network scanning, which adds additional network traffic to the ICS network. Because of the common segmentation with firewalls of ICS networks, scanner nodes in each sub-network are necessary. The distribution of active scan nodes typically adds additional cross connections within segmented ICS networks. In this paper, we introduce a secure scanning architecture for fragile ICS networks. Our architecture is based on scanning nodes, which use the concept of hardware-based data diodes to e.g. separate the critical control network from the office network. To ensure a gentle scan on fragile ICS networks, the scan node provide a bandwidth limitation of the scan, to reduce risk of influences within ICS networks. We implemented a Proof of Concept (PoC) system and evaluated it within our industrial testbed, to show the feasibility of our architecture.

Therefore, higher education institutions are offering computer programming as a module not only in computer related programmes but other programmes as well. However, the number of students that underperform in programming is significantly higher than the non-programming modules. It is, therefore, crucial to be able to accurately predict the performance of students pursuing programming since this will help in identifying students that may underperform and the necessary support interventions can be timeously put in place to assist these students. The objective of this study is therefore to obtain the most effective Educational Data Mining approaches used to identify those students that may underperform in computer programming. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis) approach was used in conducting the meta-analysis. The databases searched were, namely, ACM, Google Scholar, IEEE, Pro-Quest, Science Direct and Scopus. A total of 11 scientific research publications were included in the meta-analysis for this study from 220 articles identified through database searching. The residual amount of heterogeneity was high (τ2 = 0.03; heterogeneity I2 = 99.46% with heterogeneity chi-square = 1210.91, a degree of freedom = 10 and P = &gt;0.001). The estimated pooled performance of the algorithms was 24% (95% CI (13%, 35%). Meta-regression analysis indicated that none of the moderators included have influenced the heterogeneity of studies. The result of effect estimates against its standard error indicated publication bias with a P-value of 0.013. These meta-analysis findings indicated that the pooled estimate of algorithms is high. © 2021.

As IT/OT (information technology/operational technology) systems are evolving technologically, so are the cyber security threats faced by the offshore oil and gas assets. This paper aims to raise the awareness of cyber security threats and the organizational and technical measures that need to be adopted by the oil and gas industry for remote and complex assets in the upstream sector. A comprehensive literature review covering the areas of new IT/OT systems integration and cyber security risk analysis and management is presented. The results of a survey on the subject of cyber security for offshore oil and gas assets are also presented, and they provide valuable insight into the current industry culture and the perception of cyber security concepts. The importance of organizational culture, personnel training and involvement, as well as corporate engagement and support in the subject of cyber security is highlighted. © 2021 by the authors.

Research presented in this paper developed a risk assessment for business model digitisation (RADi) matrix which consists of technical, competences, employee and customer consent, data security, and financial risk. The expert evaluation uses the FARE method as a multi-criteria decision support approach. The results determine which parts of a business model driven by the Industry 4.0 are most affected by different risks. The results indicate the greatest impact is on customer channels, key resources, revenue stream, and customer segments, whilst key partners are the least impacted. Our research demonstrates that the RADi model can be used by firms to identify and plan for critical risks as well as to implement the digitisation of business models. Policymakers will find the RADi approach useful to anticipate risks and prioritise public support and regional development.

In emerging markets, the complexity and challenges of distributing critical products and services in significantly unequal markets are much higher. Governments have been forced to innovate policies and strategies to achieve successful distribution of products and services to poor households and rural areas. This chapter reviews such policies in various market sectors. The sectors are specifically chosen as capital-intensive, critical services, since broadband internet, in line with the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0), is fast becoming critical to bridge the digital divide and boost economic growth in emerging markets. The underlying focus is on fifth-generation (5G) and millimeter-wave technologies, emerging technologies that could have a major impact on unserved markets. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.",,"Commerce; Costs; Industry 4.0; Millimeter waves; Service industry; Broadband Internet; Critical service; Economic growths; Emerging markets; Emerging technologies; Industrial revolutions; Millimeter-wave technology; Products and services; 5G mobile communication systems","Andres, LA, Thibert, M, Cordoba, CL, Danilenko, AV, Joseph, G, Borja-Vega, C, Doing more with less.

We present an affordable, realtime hardware firewall solution for securely isolating the cyber-physical devices from the untrusted, Internet facing networks, while still being able to remotely control them from trusted devices. We take on the insecure Modbus protocol and enhance it to ensure an authenticated industrial communication channel while keeping its strict latency requirements satistifed.

The adoption of technologies like Industry 4.0, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) in critical infrastructures have made it a lucrative target for cyberattackers. Protecting critical infrastructure is of paramount importance due to the sensitive nature of the data coupled with the resource-constrained nature of the devices. The advent of blockchains can be a significant enabler for protecting critical infrastructure through the use of immutable ledger for storing the operations. However, blockchains are computationally expensive, have limited scalability and incur significant delays in processing transactions thus necessitating the development of a lightweight platform while retaining the functionality. This paper develops a lightweight blockchain based framework for protecting critical infrastructure by leveraging its hierarchical nature. Evaluation using embedded devices shows that our proposed framework minimizes the execution time of blockchain operations thus making it suitable for protecting critical infrastructure. Finally, our proposed framework is generic, in that it can be applied to any of the domains operating in the critical infrastructure. © 2020 IEEE","Blockchain; Critical Infrastructure; Internet of Things","Blockchain; Industrial internet of things (IIoT); Public works; Security of data; Critical infrastructure protection; Embedded device; Vital systems; Critical infrastructures","Alcaraz, C., Zeadally, S., Critical infrastructure protection: Requirements and challenges for the 21st century (2015) International Journal of Critical Infrastructure Protection, 8, pp. 53-66; Rinaldi, S.M., Peerenboom, J.P., Kelly, T.K., Identifying, understanding, and analyzing critical infrastructure interdependencies (2001) IEEE Control Systems Magazine, 21 (6), pp. 11-25; Zhaoyang, D., Fengji, L., Liang, G., Blockchain: A secure, decentralized, trusted cyber infrastructure solution for future energy systems (2018) Journal of Modern Power Systems and Clean Energy, 6 (5), pp. 958-967; Bahga, A., Madisetti, V., Blockchain platform for industrial internet of things (2016) Journal of Software Engineering and Applications, 9 (10), pp. 533-546; Seok, B., Park, J., Park, J.H., A lightweight hash-based blockchain architecture for industrial IoT (2019) Applied Sciences, 9 (18), pp. 37-40; Danzi, P., Popovski, P., Towards blockchain networks tailored to IoT devices (2019) Proc.

In the current work, cohort intelligence socio-inspired metaheuristic has been employed for predictive modeling of a flexible robotic arm system. Robotic arm acceleration was modeled based on robot structure reaction torque as the input parameter. This model had a second order transfer function structure consisting of one zero and two poles for better predictability of the robotic arm dynamics. The model parameters were estimated using Cohort Intelligence (CI) socio-inspired algorithm. For comparisons, model parameters were also estimated by a nature inspired method - Genetic Algorithm (GA). Estimation results indicate that both CI and GA obtained similar FIT of system dynamics; 74.78 % and 74.27 % respectively. However, due to the higher number of the average function counts in GA (5480) as compared to CI (2379), the computation time for the best cost function was found to be much lesser in CI (10.65 seconds) as compared to GA (45.77 seconds). Thus, for similar fitting predictive models, the CI converges to the optimum model parameters much faster than GA. This indicates the superiority of the socio-inspired CI metahueristic towards faster predictive modeling of complex robotic systems in industry. © 2020 IEEE.","Cohort Intelligence; flexible robotic arm; Genetic Algorithm; predictive modeling; socio inspired optimization; system identification","Biomimetics; Cost functions; Fits and tolerances; Genetic algorithms; Industrial robots; Intelligent robots; Parameter estimation; Robotic arms; Robotics; Computation time; Estimation results; Flexible robotics; Function structures; Model parameters; Predictive modeling; Predictive models; Robot structures; Predictive analytics","Tovey, H.J., Ratcliff, K., Toso, K.E., Hinchliffe, P.W., (2001) Robotic Arm DLUs for Performing Surgical Tasks, , May 15 US Patent 6, 231, 565; Islam, R.U., Iqbal, J., Manzoor, S., Khalid, A., Khan, S., An autonomous image-guided robotic system simulating industrial applications (2012) 2012 7th International Conference on System of Systems Engineering (SoSE)., pp. 344-349; Jacobsen, R.A., Rosenwasser, S.N., Bromley, B.W., Preston, J.L., Chester, D.B., (2005) Apparatus and Method for Non-destructive Inspection of Large Structures, , Jun. 21 uS Patent 6, 907, 799; Sekhar, R., Singh, T., Shah, P., ARX/ARMAX modeling and fractional order control of surface roughness in turning nanocomposites (2019) 2019 International Conference on Mechatronics, Robotics and Systems Engineering (MoRSE)., pp. 97-102; Shah, P., Sekhar, R., Closed loop system identification of a DC motor using fractional order model (2019) 2019 International Conference on Mechatronics, Robotics and Systems Engineering (MoRSE)., pp. 69-74; Shah, P., Agashe, S., Vyawahare, V., System identification with fractional-order models: A comparative study with different model structures (2018) Progress in Fractional Differentiation and Applications, 4 (4), pp. 533-552; Mandloi, R., Shah, P., Methods for closed loop system identification in industry (2015) Journal of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Research, 7 (1), pp. 892-896; Sekhar, R., Singh, T.P., Shah, P., Multi input system modeling and fractional order control of cutting forces in machining nanocomposites (2020) 3rd-International Conference on Powder, Granule and Bulk Solids: Innovations and Applications; Kulkarni, A.J., Durugkar, I.P., Kumar, M., Cohort intelligence: A self supervised learning behavior (2013) Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC), 2013 Ieee International Conference On., pp. 1396-1400; Bhambhani, A., Shah, P., PID parameter optimization using cohort intelligence technique for DC motor control system (2016) 2016 International Conference on Automatic Control and Dynamic Optimization Techniques (ICACDOT)., pp. 465-468; Shah, P., Agashe, S., Kulkarni, A.J., Design of a fractional PIλDμ controller using the cohort intelligence method (2018) Frontiers of Information Technology & Electronic Engineering, 19 (3), pp. 437-445; Shah, P., Kulkarni, A.J., Application of variations of cohort intelligence in designing fractional PID controller for various systems (2019) Socio-cultural Inspired Metaheuristics., pp. 175-192. , Springer; Krishnasamy, G., Kulkarni, A.J., Paramesran, R., A hybrid approach for data clustering based on modified cohort intelligence and k-means (2014) Expert Systems with Applications, 41 (13), pp. 6009-6016; Kulkarni, A.J., Krishnasamy, G., Abraham, A., Cohort intelligence for solving travelling salesman problems (2017) Cohort Intelligence: A Socio-inspired Optimization Method., pp. 75-86. , Springer; Mohan, S., Parameter estimation of nonlinear muskingum models using genetic algorithm (1997) Journal of Hydraulic Engineering, 123 (2), pp. 137-142; Liepe, J., Kirk, P., Filippi, S., Toni, T., Barnes, C.P., Stumpf, M.P., A framework for parameter estimation and model selection fromexperimental data in systems biology using approximate Bayesian computation (2014) Nature Protocols, 9 (2), pp. 439-456; Kulkarni, O., Kulkarni, N., Kulkarni, A.J., Kakandikar, G., (2016) Constrained Cohort Intelligence Using Static and Dynamic Penalty Function Approach for Mechanical Components Design, , arXiv preprint arXiv: 1610.06009; Li, S., Kang, L., Zhao, X.-M., A survey on evolutionary algorithm based hybrid intelligence in bioinformatics (2014) BioMed Research International, 2014; De Moor, B., De Gersem, P., De Schutter, B., Favoreel, W., Daisy: A database for identification of systems (1997) Journal A, 38, pp. 4-5; Rs Components: Electronic, Electrical & Mechanical Components., , https://in.rsdelivers.com/, [Online]; Tangirala, A.K., (2018) Principles of System Identification: Theory and Practice., , Crc Press",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104823008

Against the backdrop of the global energy crisis, renewable energy has received great attention from countries around the world. Due to the characteristics of geographical dispersion, randomness, volatility and uncontrollability of renewable energy, the centralized traditional electrical energy networks cannot meet the management requirements of large-scale access to renewable energy. The emergence of the energy internet has enabled the effective use of renewable energy. As a distributed trading and data management technology, blockchain solves the problem of distributed electrical energy trading in the energy Internet. However, the distributed energy trading based on blockchain cannot satisfy the rational matching of trading objects. Therefore, we propose a blockchain-based electrical energy trading system BC-TMS Blockchain-based trading matching system, which can reasonably match trading objects according to the user's personalized needs and maximize the benefits of both parties to the trading. At the same time, the system also provides a certain degree of privacy protection. Finally, through security and application prospect analysis, we prove the usability and practicability of our proposed scheme. © 2020 ACM.","Blockchain; Energy internet; Privacy protection; Trading matching","Blockchain;

As digital technology advances, the policy environment is changing. However, advances in digital technology do not have the same effect on all local governments. Instead, the possibility of new gaps in different regions has raised a new problem depending on the level of digital technology acceptance and capabilities. However, objective methods of measuring local informatization levels are still insufficient. The purpose of this study is to fill these gaps and develop a diagnostic model that can identify different levels of local informatization. This study aims to evaluate the performance of informatization from a holistic perspective that encompasses providers, users, and services. First, the provider sector includes Information and Communications Technology (ICT)-related organizations, people, budgets, local informatization networks, and institutions from the perspective of informatization input or infrastructure. Second, the service sector consists of essential services and provisions provided by local governments for citizens and internal users, and the efforts to utilize and apply new technologies related to the Fourth Industrial Revolution from the perspective of informatization projects. Third, the user sector considers not only functional performance, such as the utilization rate related to local informatization, but also reaction, satisfaction, performance, and participation of citizens and civil servants as users. The index developed in this study has the following two purposes. First, it was applied to the evaluation of 245 local governments - 17 regional and 228 basic local governments - in South Korea to determine the level of informatization of each local government. Second, the analysis of each sub-indicator can then be used to diagnose the problems of each local government's informatization policy and develop improvement measures. The development of the indicators in this study is as follows. First, the Delphi method was conducted with 18 participants, including experts, to ensure the validity of the indicators. Through this, the sub-indicators and indicator setting of four areas, including the supplier and infrastructure sectors, service and delivery system sectors, performance, and consumer sectors, and the overall indicators were verified. Second, the Analytic Hierarchy Process was conducted to verify the validity of the developed index model and synthesize individual indicators. This determined the importance of the substantial categories and sub-indicators of each significant category that were identified. The model was divided into three major categories and 11 middle categories, and the weights of the indicators were separately organized by regional and basic local governments. © 2020 ACM.","Digital Government; Index; Local Governments; Local Informatization Measurement","Budget control; Service industry; Digital technologies; Functional performance; Holistic perspectives; Improvement measure; Industrial revolutions; Information and communications technology; Infrastructure sector; Intelligent information; Public policy","Egidijus, B., Guonda, C., Cristiano, C., Vaida, G., Luka, K., Giovanni, L., Loreta, M., Irene, V., (2019) Exploring Digital Government Transformation in the EU-Analysis of the State of the Art and Reviewof Literature, , EUR 29987 EN, Publications Office of the European Union, Luxembourg; (2014) Recommendation of the Council on Digital Government Strategies, OECD, , https://www.oecd.org/gov/digital-government/Recommendation-digital-government-strategies.pdf, Paris.

One of the actively developing areas of development of intelligent control systems is the condition monitoring of equipment. Condition monitoring helps not only to prevent the sudden failure of equipment components, but also to determine in advance their actual life, which helps to develop an appropriate plan for equipment shutdowns and repair works. The development of equipment monitoring technologies requires new solutions. In the presented article, non-contact technology for conditional monitoring of an intelligent electric drive is proposed. The technology is based on monitoring of forces transmitted by rotating parts of electric drives by calculating a torque of electric motors. An initial data for calculating a torque are the measured values of currents, voltages and rotational speeds in an adjustable electric drive, as well as own parameters of electric motors. Control and monitoring of equipment is carried out by using a universal supervisory control and data acquisition system. During the study, a hardware and software implementation of the new approach to the condition monitoring of electric drives was proposed. Results of modeling the response of a condition monitoring system to a change of torque in a structure of an electric drive at critical infrastructure are presented. © 2020 IEEE.","condition monitoring; electric drive; induction motor; SCADA; smart manufacturing; torque","Biomedical engineering; Data acquisition; Digital storage; Electric drives; Electric motors; Operating costs; Condition monitoring systems; Control and monitoring; Electrical drives; Equipment monitoring; Hardware and software implementations; Non-contact conditions; Rotational speed; Smart manufacturing; Condition monitoring","Bolovin, E.V., Glazyrin, A.S., Method for identifying parameters of submersible induction motors of electrical submersible pump units for oil production, "" (in Russian (2017) Bulletin of the Tomsk Polytechnic University.

At present, most researches on URLLC use Shannon capacity for infinite blocklength, which is not suitable for short packet transmission adopted by URLLC. In this paper, we consider the resource allocation of mission-critical service in the smart factory, where IIoT devices receive the control information from both base station (BS) and relay. The purpose of this paper is to jointly optimize the power allocation, the position of relay, and the blocklength with finite blocklength information theory to minimize the decoding error rate of the device. This paper proposes a low-complexity algorithm that effectively solves this optimization problem. Simulation results show that relay- assisted transmission and optimized resource allocation can significantly reduce the error rate. © 2020 IEEE.","finite blocklength information theory; IIoT; relay-assisted; URLLC","5G mobile communication systems; Computational complexity; Information theory; Resource allocation; Control information; Low complexity algorithm; Low-latency communication; Mission critical; Optimization problems; Power allocations; Relay-assisted transmissions; Shannon capacity; Industrial internet of things (IIoT)","Chang, B., Zhang, L., Li, L., Zhao, G., Chen, Z., Optimizing resource allocation in urllc for real-time wireless control systems (2019) IEEE Trans.

Such computing devices have become attractive targets of attackers, as they derive critical insights that can often regulate the underlying industrial processes. Security administrators have to analyze vulnerable configurations, and evaluate feasible hardening options to secure such systems. In this work, we investigate the security threats to the edge devices in the IoT-assisted networks because of the inherent vulnerabilities present in the IoT devices, and formulate a novel graphical security model to conduct vulnerability-based risk assessment in such networks. We further propose a set of combinatorial optimization techniques for security hardening. For securing the target devices, we propose a randomized algorithm to enforce isolation of potential target devices from the attackers. The algorithm produces the least number of vulnerabilities, the removal of which protects the targets. For densely connected networks, we propose another algorithm to identify a minimal set of vulnerabilities to be hardened so as to keep potential targets below admissible levels of risk. The approach includes the formulation of an integer linear program, which is relaxed to solve in polynomial time, followed by a round-off technique to find the actual solution.

The realization of CI is based on the active participation and involvement of the firm’s entire workforce – with everybody making incremental improvements, every day. This of course includes shop floor operators. In this paper, we explore various aspects that influence the successful involvement of shop floor operators in CI activities, by adopting a case study approach. The case company has achieved only partial success with CI on the shop floor, despite repeated efforts. As a result of the study, several organizational factors emerge as critical success factors for securing involvement and engagement of operators in CI, with positive results. Raising awareness of these critical factors may help manufacturing firms adopt an alternative approach to CI which promises to increase the level of operator participation in CI. © 2020, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Case study; Continuous improvement; Operator; Shop floor","Industrial management; Manufacture; Case study approach; Continuous improvements; Critical factors; Critical success factor; Incremental improvements; Industrial revolutions; Manufacturing firms; Organizational factors; Floors","Womack, J.P., Jones, D.T., (1996) Lean Thinking, , Simon & Schuster, New York; New, S.J., Celebrating the enigma: the continuing puzzle of the Toyota production system (2007) Int.

The paper aims to identify critical business processes that can substantially benefit from Industry 4.0 and Information Technology solutions in a Natural Gas Distribution Company which distributes Natural gas in Greece in Medium and Low Pressure. The research conducted identified the company’s business processes and highlighted these which are critical to its operation. Having identified the technological advancements in the Gas sector, the business processes that can benefit from Industry 4.0 and Information and Communication Technologies were recognized. The results revealed three critical business processes that can be radically improved: management of new customers’ connections, project management of works projects and network maintenance. Technological approaches that can transform these processes were identified to be a real-time collaborative CRM system, a real-time collaborative project management system integrated with an appropriate document management system, smart meters, sensors and actuators for real-time monitoring of important operational variables and a monitoring system which collects and generates consolidated information in a Control Room. Identification of the processes into which Industry 4.0 and information technologies can lead to the introduction of corresponding solutions, can increase operational efficiency of company’s network and minimise running costs. The research effort should be continued in order to achieve higher integration between business processes, Industry 4.0 concepts and Information Systems. © 2020, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Gas sector; Industry 4.0; Key business processes; Maintenance; Utilities","Gases; Industrial management; Industry 4.0; Information management; Information services; Infrastructure as a service (IaaS); Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Project management; Service industry; Document management systems; Gas distribution company; Gas distribution network; Information and Communication Technologies; Information technology solutions; Infrastructure managements; Operational efficiencies; Technological advancement; Gas industry","Faheem, M., Smart grid communication and information technologies in the perspective of industry 4.0: opportunities and challenges (2018) Comput.

The dependent variable in this study is profitability, while the independent variables are bank age, and bank performance. In addition, profit distribution is treated as an intervening variable. The sampling method used was purposive sampling where samples were taken with the provisions of 12 Public Islamic banks that publish annual reports from 2015 to 2017. The results of the data analysis show that bank age does not have a significant effect on profit ability, but NPF (Non-Performing Financing) significant effect on profit sharing. Further, although FDR (Financing to Deposit), and CI (Cost to Income) have no significant effect on profit sharing. Finally, this study also reveals that profit sharing has a significant effect on banks profitability. The implication of theoretical and managerial practices is discussed. Building a competitive advantage to face industry 4.0, one of them with adopting technology is very important for Islamic banking to improve the performance of Islamic banks, improve efficiency and productivity, which will certainly support the performance of profitability. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,"Suhartanto, D., Farhani, N.H., Muflih, M., Setiawan, S., Loyalty intention towards Islamic Bank: The role of religiosity, image, and trust (2018) International Journal of Economics & Management, 12, pp. 137-151; Supriyanto, E.B., (2019) Perbankan Syariah: Kinerja Yang Buruk Karena Tata Kelola, , http://infobanknews.com/perbankan-syariah-kinerja-yang-buruk-karena-tata-kelola/; Lahrech, N., Lahrech, A., Boulaksil, Y., Transparency and performance in Islamic banking: Implications on profit distribution (2014) International Journal of Islamic and Middle Eastern Finance and Management, 7 (1), pp. 61-88; Khaldi, K., Hamdouni, A., Islamic financial intermediation: Equity, efficiency and risk (2011) International Research Journal of Finance and Economics, 65, pp. 145-160; Farook, S., Hassan, M.K., Clinch, G., Profit distribution management by Islamic banks: An empirical investigation (2012) The Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance, 52 (3), pp. 333-347; Kipesha, F.E., Impact of Size and Age on Firm Performance: Evidences from Microfinance Institutions in Tanzania (2013) Research Journal of Finance An Accounting, 4, pp. 105-116; Loderer, C., Waelchli, U., (2010) Firm Age and Performance.

The water infrastructure and generally automation/SCADA systems may be vulnerable to attacks. In case of critical infrastructures, the protection is necessary because an eventual successful attack can cause major damages. The paper presents a solution for protecting water pumping stations from threats using a honeypot inside an OPC UA wrapping structure. As known, Industry 4.0 and Industrial Internet of Things concepts are moving the industry towards interoperability and interoperation. OPC UA is the defined and widely accepted interfacing solution. The transition to OPC UA for both new and legacy systems can be realized through wrappers, such middleware protocol conversion and data wrapping structures are studied and developed. The proposed honeypot is conceived for Node-RED based applications being able to access Modbus, S7, OPC UA local structures and exposing tags in OPC UA server.

The specified theory is based on the results of the scientific-applied sections of biological and cybernetic immunology. In the developed concept it was taken into account that the neutralization of malicious influences should not lead to a denial of service for the entire system and to a loss of the functional semantics of calculations. Using interrelated probative, verification and testing programming, a model for restoring functional program specifications was developed. It was developed with separation by levels: semantic (functional, logical and algebraic models are defined to determine the base of functionally-logic specifications of programs); syntactic (defined models to form automatic machines for the detection and neutralization of malicious influences); semantically syntactic (models are defined for applying the simplest forms of program calculation semantics based on graphical, schematic, and network representations). In order to prove the correctness of functional semantics of the ""cleared"" calculations, a mathematical apparatus of the similarity theory and calculation dimensions were developed. The п-converter was identified; this operator allows forming the required ""passports"" of trusted computations in the conditions of disturbances. Calculations with ""antibodies"" are represented by regular schemes in the system of algorithmic algebras of V. M. Glushkov. A semantically controlled translator based on formal automata with abstract memory was developed for the interpretation of the input program of the trusted computations and type of actions.

Such models provide a valuable source of information in general port safety and security planning as well as emergency response operations. This aspect is particularly crucial as ports belong to a nation's critical infrastructure, where its multiple supply chains and hinterland connections are sensitive to disruptions of any kind. Dealing with a rising number of disrupting externalities and increasing occupancy rates, ports have a constant need for affordable technological innovations with regard to risk management. Based on practical experiments, this paper reveals the possibility of generating realistic 3D models on the example of port facilities. It further reveals that initial states of a 3D model can be generated in a short timeframe, providing a valuable quick-response information source for first responder in emergency scenarios. © 2019: The Royal Institution of Naval Architects.",,"3D modeling; Antennas; Emergency services; Industry 4.0; Marine industry; Risk management; Supply chains; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Emergency response; Emergency scenario; First responders; Information sources; Multiple supplies; Safety and securities; Technological advances; Technological innovation; Costs","Abdullah, Q., Bethel, J., Hussain, M., Munjy, R., Photogrammetric project and mission planning (2013) Manual of Photogrammetry, pp. 1187-1220. , MCGLONE, J.C.

Its objective is to enable real-time information exchange between people, machines, products and resources, providing new opportunities for improved safety, quality, productivity and cost factors which can be applied in all stages of Product Lifecycle Management (PLM). The application of lean principles and practices where Industry 4.0 is deployed can leverage real-time processing visibility into even greater productivity improvements if implemented correctly. To do this, companies need to go beyond the implementation of the familiar lean tools and practices such as 5S, visual management and management directed kaizen activities etc. to consider the thinking behind the tools, especially the role of the team members. An over-reliance on technology risks undervaluing the importance of human innovative capacity which can significantly impact the ability to conduct systematic problem solving, adversely effecting daily operational performance and significantly reducing continuous improvement (CI) capacity. This conceptual paper introduces the major elements and thinking of the Toyota Production System (TPS), also referred to as ‘True Lean’, which are often hidden or underdeveloped within the popular understanding of lean. This paper illustrates how TPS-thinking can be operationalized to support and sustain a CI environment while leveraging the improved visibility possible with Industry 4.0 to integrate all stages of PLM. © 2019, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Industry 4.0; Lean; PLM; Product Lifecycle Management; Toyota Production System; True Lean","Automobile manufacture; Digital twin; Human resource management; Industry 4.0; Information management; Internet of things; Lean production; Productivity; Visibility; Information and Communication Technologies; Internet of thing (IOT); Lean; Product life cycle management; Productivity improvements; Real time information exchange; Toyota Production System; True Lean; Life cycle","Sanders, A., Elangeswaran, C., Elangeswaran, C., Wulfsberg, J., Industry 4.0 implies lean manufacturing: Research activities in industry 4.0 function as enablers for lean manufacturing (2016) J.

Gartner predicts that 20 billion devices will be connected to the internet by the year 2020. Although most of these devices will be consumer devices, businesses and industry are already exploring the possibilities and capabilities of IoT devices to gain a competitive advantage. The Industrial Internet of things (IIoT) is a name given to IoT devices used in the monitoring and control of industrial and related processes. These include transport, energy, healthcare, retail, manufacturing and operations. As IIoT integrates into business processes it also converges with cloud computing, mobile and other platforms. This increases the complexity of the design as well as introduces more risk. For organisations, the primary objective of IoT is to provide data and business insights to assist executives in making informed decisions via dashboards and visualisation. Information and cyber security is often neglected or non-existing when it comes to IoT and IIoT. Europol recently indicated that threat actors now rely on IoT devices to target critical infrastructure via Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Globally many IT security and governance standards and control frameworks from various organisations are available. When it comes to IoT standards, there are many standards, frameworks and guidelines that have been publish. Each IoT vendor has its own guideline and would want their standard to be the one used. Having too many standards, frameworks and controls to choose from, increases the likelihood of either the wrong standard being chosen or none. The other challenge is how far does one go to secure an IoT or IIoT device? This paper will provide an overview of the differences and similarities between IoT and IIoT, as well as the threats, vulnerabilities, risks and incidents related to them in the transport infrastructure.

As a result, IoT devices used in critical infrastructures such as energy, health-care, and water supply systems are vulnerable to attacks. A successful attack on such safety-critical infrastructures may have life-threatening consequences. On the other hand, existing security mechanisms are not enough to protect constrained IoT devices. Therefore, we need better security mechanisms and tools to manage and protect IoT devices from malicious use. In emerging paradigms like Internet-of-Things (IoT) platforms, Industry 4.0, collaborative portals, and many others, we deal with a multi-tenant architecture. In a multi-tenant architecture, the owners want to secure their own integrity, confidentiality, and functionality goals without being concerned about the goals of other entities. In this paper, we present a framework to negotiate, compromise, and inter-operate between different services or platforms to fulfill a purpose. Furthermore, to ensure correct and safe operation of IoT systems, we must assure that the integrity of the underlying systems and processes is properly executed as intended i.e., the processes cannot be changed in an unauthorized way. In this paper, we present our Petri Net based workflow specification and enforcement framework to realize workflow-aware access control and to protect the process integrity of IoT applications. The Petri Net models are amenable to formal verification. The resulting workflows have other properties such as the ability to recover from error conditions. In addition, we present a method to achieve distributed access control and accountability integrated with our framework. We allow practitioner-friendly tools to collect requirements and goals to design secure IoT systems and processes. Finally, we present a guide to implement our framework with existing development environments and validate the methodology using concrete use case scenarios. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,"Access control; Computer software; Critical infrastructures; Embedded systems; Network security; Petri nets; Public works; Safety engineering; Water supply; Water supply systems; Collaborative Portal; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Development environment; Distributed access controls; Internet of Things (IOT); Multi-tenant architectures; Systems and process; Workflow specification; Internet of things","van der Aalst, W.M.P., Verification of workflow nets (1997) ICATPN 1997.

Nevertheless, this technological revolution also raises new challenges pertaining to the security design and maintenance of industrial installations. To this end, emerging paradigms such as Software-Defined Networks (SDN) demonstrated to represent a promising candidate and a key enabler for closing the loop between detection of cyber attacks and the mitigation strategies provisioned into Industrial Control Systems (ICS). However, the development and testing of SDN-enabled security solutions for ICS in production environments can threaten the operation of mission-critical services. To address these issues, this work documents the development of a testbed for performing security experiments with SDN-enabled ICS. The testbed supports custom test scenarios, including the recreation of large-scale industrial SDN-based infrastructures, traffic generators, as well as, tools for monitoring and analyzing the generated data. It leverages the Mininet network emulation tool and the POX SDN controller. An extensive case study demonstrates the applicability of the testbed. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Industrial control system; Reconfiguration; Software defined networking; Testbed; Virtualization","Control systems; Network security; Software defined networking; Testbeds; Virtualization; Development and testing; Industrial control systems; Industrial installations; Industrial revolutions; Production environments; Reconfiguration; Technological revolution; Technological solution; Intelligent control","Cherepanov, A., (2016) Black Energy by the SSHBearDoor: Attacks Against Ukrainian News Media and Electric Industry; Alcorn, J., Melton, S., Edward Chow, C., Portable SDN testbed prototype (2017) Dependable Systems and Networks Workshop (DSN-W), pp. 109-110; Byres, E., Using ANSI/ISA-99 standards to improve control system security (2012) White Paper, Tofino Security, , P Eng, and ISA Fellow (2012); Candell, R., Stouffer, K., Anand, D., A cybersecurity testbed for industrial control systems (2014) Proceedings of the 2014 Process Control and Safety Symposium; Caviglione, L., Gaggero, M., Cambiaso, E., Aiello, M., Measuring the energy consumption of cyber security (2017) IEEE Communications Magazine, 55 (7), pp. 58-63. , https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2017.1600955, (2017); Chen, T.M., Abu-Nimeh, S., Lessons from stuxnet (2011) Computer, 44 (4), pp. 91-93. , https://doi.org/10.1109/MC.2011.115, (april 2011); Chou, L.-D., Tseng, C.-W., Tseng, C.-H., Chen, Y.-M., The novel SDN testbed with virtual network functions placement (2016) Software Networking (ICSN), International Conference On, pp. 1-5. , IEEE; Cintuglu, M.H., Mohammed, O.A., Akkaya, K., Selcuk Uluagac, A., A survey on smart grid cyber-physical system testbeds (2017) IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials, 19 (1), pp. 446-464. , (2017); Dorsch, N., Kurtz, F., Dalhues, S., Robitzky, L., Häger, U., Wietfeld, C., Intertwined: Software-defined communication networks for multi-agent system-based smart grid control (2016) IEEE International Conference on Smart Grid Communications (SmartGridComm), pp. 254-259. , https://doi.org/10.1109/SmartGridComm.2016.7778770; Drath, R., Horch, A., Industrie 4.0: Hit or hype?

The speed of the trains depends on the rail conditions. The state of the rails needs continuous control to determine the train speed and continuous traffic and transport. The goal of the Industry 4.0 is to build a smart industry and industrial environment [1]. Part of this smart system is the traffic and the transportation on road and railway too. The continuous railway transportation needs quality railroads and trains. The rails have complex load during their lifetime. In this research, we wanted to find a test method and innovate an experimental setup for the continuous state control of rails. In our work, we wanted to find a relationship between propagations of the rail surface damage and the loads. Also based on failure propagation rules we wanted innovate a special installation for in situ monitoring the process of the rail surface damage, predict the defects and crack propagations.

Use of internet comes with its misuse, namely Internet Addiction (IA). Mood disorders have been reported to be associated with heavy internet use, especially among young adults. We assessed the prevalence of IA and its association with insomnia, anxiety, depression and stress among University students. Material & Methods: In a cross-sectional survey using an anonymous, self-administered questionnaire, information on socio-demographic characteristics was collected from all willing students. Previously validated and standardized scales like Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS 42) and Young Internet Addiction Test (YIAT) were used. Results: Among 430 average YIAT score was 29.69 ± 16.66. Potential IA prevalence rate was 13% with a 95% CI of 10 - 16%. Prevalence of depression was 44.1%, Anxiety was 59.1% and stress was 37.2%. Significant correlations were found between potential IA and insomnia, stress, anxiety and depression (p-value < 0.0001). ISI, DASS stress scores were significantly associated with internet addiction. Conclusion: Potential internet addiction often exists with other psychological problems which warrant its detection in order to provide appropriate counselling and supervision © 2018, Indian Association of Preventive and Social Medicine.

Methods: Up to Decerrier I st, 1995.443 children of HIV-infected mothers were followed up prospectvely from brth for at least 6 months. Infection status was determined in 368 of them by concordant resüts of PCR and p24 antigen detection after heat-mediated disruption of immune complexes r. at least 2 samples taken after the age of I month. 62 were found to be infected, giving a transmission rate (TR) of 16.8%, 95%-conJdence interval (CI) 13.3-19.5% ZDV was urfversally recommended for HlV-posrtive pregnant women in Switzerland in mid 1994. Associations of ns factors with TR were investigated by univariate and muluvariate (logistic regression) anaVsis. Odds raws (OR) with Q and X2-tests were used. Results: ZDV was applied in 45 cases (75% of all registered pregnancies since mid 1994). Infection status was known in 23 children, 2 (8.7%) were infected (OR 0.35.
